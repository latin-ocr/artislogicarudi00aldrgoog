DE DIVISIONE. 69

ne contineanturz) uam sine distinctione frustra
est partitio. ¹

l. Eaeh member of the division should compre·
heud a smaller number of subordinate classes or os
individuals than the subject or term divided.

To olussify animale as intelligent aud not-intelli·
pent beinys, would offend against this first rule;
since each oi those classes contains something not
included in the word Animal.

2. The aggregate ol all the members of a division
taken together should comprehend every thing de·
noted by the divided term, and nothing more.

ln the following passage Cicero (or probably the
interpolator) offends against this rule. “Virtus
omnis tribus rebus fere vertitur: quarum una est
in perspiciendo quid in quique re verum sincerum·
que sit: alterum, cohibere motus animi turbatos,
appetitionesque obedientes efficere rationi: tertium,
iis quibuscum congregamur u'ti moderate et scienter.”
(Off. ii. 5.) The parts together do not equal the
whole. The virtue of fortitude is omitted. “ Prae·
terire aliquid maxinmm vitium in dividendo est.”

3. An entire distinction between the parts or
members is essential to a correct division. This
rulo is violeted il the diuisione be such that any in-
dividual or subordinate class may be arranged under
more than oue head.

The common division of the Operatione of the
mind into simple Apprelteust'on, Judpmenr, Reusoa-
inq, and Mariand, offouds against the third rule.
Metltod is not opposed to, but is comprised in, sim-
ple Apprelremimr.

lrord Bacorr points out an error of the same kind,
when he says, “ Differentiam Motirs naturales et uio·
lenti maximi euru socordia introducunt philosophi:
cum omnis motus violentus etiam naturalis revera
sit.’'
