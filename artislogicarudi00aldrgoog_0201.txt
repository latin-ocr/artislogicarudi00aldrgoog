lna DE MODORUM

recta itur; per reliquos eodem perveniri potest,
prius tamen alio deflectendum est.

The illatire force ol syllogisms in the first four
modes of the firet ligure has beon already shown.
But every correct argument in the other ligures
may be reduced to an equivalent syllogiem in sorae
one of these modes, by changing one or both ol the
premises into othere of the sarae signification, so
that the pair of promises thus obtained shall involve
the principle oi the first ligure. For instance, the
following is a syllogism in the second figure:

No birds are oiriparoae animala ,·
Bate are niaiparoar animam therefore,
Betr are not birds,

But by substituting for tho major premiss its
simple converse, (which is necessarily implied in
it,) the same argument may be thur exprersod in
the first figure:

No oivipnroas animala are birdr;
Batr are viviparoar animuin therefore
Bate are not birds.

Again‚ it may be argued in the third figure, that,

No dishonert mensures are really expedient ,-

Bur rome dishonert mensuret bear the appearance
eff expedieney ;

Therefore rome meaeareo which bear tlre appear-
ance os expedienep are not really expedient.

To which the following syllogism in the first
figure is equivalentr being deduced from ir only by
the simplo conversion ol the minor promise ε

No dhhorrert meararer are really expedient ,·

Bal rome raeawrrer which bear the appearance of
expedienqy are dalonen,-

Therefore some mearam which beor the appearance
of expedienep are aot really aperient.
