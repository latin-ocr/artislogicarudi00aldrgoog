The Fallacies of umbiynous construction are not
less absurd than those of the three preceding classes:
and yet, like those, are osten so disguised as to
delude the hearer. For instance; let it have been
stated that Tne prisoner only committed cn assault
on tte plaintiff. The context, or the tone in which
the statement was made, might show that the senti-
ment intended was, that tite prisoner was alone tn
comrnt'ttin9 tlte assonlt: and it would be a iallhcy
if it were attempted to inter that lte did no more
titan commit tlte ossault, ond was not puilty of rob-
bery or murder. But if the connexion shewed the
original intention to be, that tlte prisoner merely
ossnulted tlte desmilant without proceedinp to any
further· injnry: it would be a fallacy to infer that
he tad no accomplices in tlte assanlt.
