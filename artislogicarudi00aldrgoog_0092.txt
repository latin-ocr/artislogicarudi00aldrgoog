DE DEFINITIONE. to

the individnal objects defined: and are therefore
called physicol or natural definitione.

These are best adapted lor the explanation ol
those species oi which the individuale are familiarly
known, and obviously reducible to their natural
parts. They partake ol the character of logical de-
finitione, because they commoneo with the mention
of a genus, and most properly, the proximare genus;
while the enumerationes the parts supplies the place
ol a logical difference; as,

Btrd, an animal consisting oi a body covered with
feathers, two wings‚ two legs and leet, and abead
terminating in a horny bill.

Troe, that which consiste ol root, trunk, branchos,
leaves, and sep.

Ghoir, a machine which is composed ol a seat, a
back, and legs.

Iole, a mixture ol copperns, gall, and gum.

Entabloture‚ the architrave, frieze, and cornice of
apillar.

3. Accidentnl Definition, usually called Descrip-
tion, is the remaining species ol Real Definition. lt
describes the objector thing denoted hy any word, hy
assigning some characteristic, though not primary,
qualities belonging to it. lt is, very frequently, the
only method by which an object can be defined, in
consequence ol onr ignorance hoth of the natural and
component parts, and also ol the metaphysical parts;
especially ol that leading quality which constitutes
the logical Difference. 'lhos we defim or rather
describe animale, plants, mineram, and other natural
objecta, by an enumeration ol their respective qua·
litias or accidents. Definitions of this kind are in-
deed usually introduced by the mention ol the ge-
nns; to which is added a sort oi artificial dil-
lerence consisting ol such a specification of charac-
teristico as may suffice to distinguish the object de·
lined irom every collateral species. For example,
