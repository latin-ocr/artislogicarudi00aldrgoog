taining that quality presented to our apprehension.
But the operation is both facilitated, and rendered
more correct, when we have tha opportunity oi
comparing many different things in which the same
quality is discoverable. Thus ii we derived our
notiou of heat only from the sun, we might be led
to consider radiunce and celestiolr'ty as essentials to
that quality, and to admit those ideas as parts oi the
aggregate denoted by tlre abstract word heat. But
when we find the same quality existing in culinary
jlre, without the latter adjunct; and produced by
friction without the formem we learn to separate it
srom those notions, and to employ the abstract term
sirnply to denote that quality by which a certain
natural sensation is produced.

The word expressing the object oi sense or of Α
mental apprehension from which this process of
abstractiou originales (aS, brother, philosopher, green-
field, accurate-jodyment) is sometimes called con·

knowledge oi the subject, and of the adherent qua·
lity.

The term Concreto Noun, though usually ern·
ployed simply as the opposite to abstract, refers to
a supposed process ol the mind exactly the reverse
oi that just described. lf we can conceive our
mind to be uncounected with the body, and eudued
with an instantaneous and intuitive knowledge, we
may suppose it to comnrence its operations with tho
notion oi the simple quality itsell, not as abstracted
from any subjects, but as ii it naturally and prima-
rily existed in a distinct, absolute, and independens
state. The mind may then be considered as pro·
ceeding to apply those qualities to particular sub·
jeets; as, to man, field, judpmeot, five. The terms
expressive of those combinations oi ideas (as, hro·
ther, philosopher, green, accurate, hot) are called corr·
crete words.
