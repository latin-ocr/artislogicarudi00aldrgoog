INDUGTIO. 288

tural philosopher at first does no more than make
an historical record (either mentally or actually) ol
the facts or phenomena which have come to his
knowledge: he then endeavours to classily those
facts3 to contrast thern with all such lacte as appear

to be of an opposite nature; and by dividing and
separating essentiale from non-essentiale, things
necessary from things contingent, he determines
end distinguishes in every object the nature from
its properties and accidents; he traces phenomens
to their physical causes or antecedents3 divests
them oi those similarities or differences which are
merely apparent3 classidas them according to their
real relations to each other; and thus discovers
those general principles or lawe according to which
all things are regulated‚ and the knowledge of which
constitutas true science.

For example; the practical minor, on the disco-
very of a pebbly rad sarad-stone, will probably asseri
without hesitation that roal may be found within a
moderate depth from the surface. His induction ie
however incomplete; he is hiessed by localities,
and judges without any soienfific acquaintance with
the structure oi the earth. The attempt may be
made, and the expectatione of the proprietor dis·
appointed. This fact presents an apparent oppo-
sition to the general principle that red send-stone on
the sarsore indicates coel babeatis. But the philoso-
pher, by more extensive examination, ascertains that
there is also another stratum os pebbly red rand-stone,
subjacent to the roal strata, bearing every great
similarity to the former. By repeated examinatione
however be discovers certain unilorm marks os dis·
tinction between the superincumbam and the sah-
jaoent stratum. This discovery at once produces an
important step in the edvancement of the sciente,
and may rescue many from the toil, expense, and
disappointment ol secking coel beneath a stratum

to which it must necessarilyssbe superior.
