doubtful principle. The conclusion deduoed from
such a premise must he as uncertain as the found·
mmmmffistmm

The various instances of this fallacy may be conr·
v prehended under three classes.

l. The most simple form ol the Petilio Principii ¹
is when the llas or assumed promise is such ae may
possibly be true; (and if trae, the argument founded
on ¹it is validz) but neither is sels-evident, nor has
been proved; and therefore is such that it may be
doubted whether it can be proved. This is what the
Schoolmen call a proof per aeque gnatum, uel per
ignotius. For example:

tte inhabitants os tlte planet Herscltel, being
endued roitb natural sensatione similar to our own,
must suffer intensely from tlte extremity of cold.
The principle that tlte inhabitants of Herscltel are
endued uitlt natural sensatione similar to our own is
bepped, that is, gratuitously assumed without proof or
the possibility of procl.

Such arguments will frequently he ascribed to a
false promise. For it is difficolt to distinguish
between that which is not proved to be true, end
that which is actually untrue. An unproved pro-
position may be conscientiously advanced by a dis-
putant, while he is not aware of its doubtfulness,
but supposes it true: and it may be with equal
conscientiousness opposed by another, under the
supposition that it is false. For the term doubtful
does not refer samuch to the objectiva uncertainty
of the principle, as to the relative uncertainty‚ de-
pending on the degree of real or supposed knowledge
ol the parties.

Moreover, if the objector deems the premiss to he
absolutely false, it is often more advantageous to
trent it as doubtful, because this may be more easy

' to prove than the other.
