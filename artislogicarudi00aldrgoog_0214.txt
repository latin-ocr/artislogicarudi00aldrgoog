VALIDITATE. 201

Reductionis per Impossibile validitas sic
ostenditur. Quoniam praemissae ac hypothesi
sunt semper verae, ergo contradictoria prae-
missae nurfquam vera: ergo Reducti conclusio
falsa: recte autem in Barbara colligitur ex
praemissis, quarum igitur una, i. e. noca, falsa
erit; quae quidem est Eapositae conclusionis
contradictoria3 ergo Reposito conclusio vera.

The argument ab impossibili consisto in the by-
pothetioal concession of the falsebood of that which
is the subject of discussion, and in the tracing ol
such concession to its consequanoes, so as to show
that it necessarily involves some manifest absurdity
or impossibility. As trutb cannot be either absurd
or impossible, it follows that the thing conceded is
not true; and consequently the dependence of the

When therefore this metbod of reasoning is ap-
plied to the reduction of Syllogisms‚ the following
process is adopted. The proposition to be esta-
blished is that the conclusion deduced by a certain
mode of syllogism is valid; thetis, is necessarily
true provided the promises be true. To prove,
this, it is pro tempore conceded, that although the
promises are true, yet the conclusion is false. And
from tbis concession it is shown, by the change
directed in each case, that one of the premissa must
unavoidably be falsa: and consequently that the
objector, ii consistent, must be guilty of tbe absurdity
of believing the same thing to be at once both
true aud false.

This kind of seduction is employed only in those
two modes in which one premiss is particular aepo-
tive ‚· namely, Burolo and Bokordo. And tbe
