the notion or the object tc which that word is appro-
priated. Hence in different languages different
words couvey the same meaning; asstitit-or, verbum,
mot, word; Τίλος, finis, fin, endr Gaza, tanvglg,
tractare. The same words also convey different
senses; for instance, the combination of forms
presented to the eye in the word pain, is not less
adapted to convey to a Frenclrman the notion
of breed, than to excite in our minds the thought of 2
aneonness. The sounds composing the word lepo
t'orm as efficient a representative of I read or I call ,
in Latin, as nipe is in Greek of Ι say. For this
reason also, even in the same language, different ’
words express very nearly the same ideas: as, ¹
peyna, proelium hostis, perduellis ,· cote, saffrope:
while ou the contrary the same vrord bears different,
and sometimes opposite senees; thus, lecsinp, denotes ,
either plecninp, or falselood5 to let, signifies to Ἴ
permit, or to hindar. ¹

Even words derived from imitation, as enchon, ,
crusii, βόμβος, scloppus, require the authority of
custom to constitute them legitimate words.

Each language moreover possessos some words ior
which there are no correspondent expressions in ἵ
another. Of this kind are the French word annui:
the Latin color the Greek λόγος, ἐκκλησιαστής· the ’
Persian pararany,· the English perlicerent. Such
combinatione cf ideas can be expressed in other ,
languages only by adopting the foreign word, or hy
circumlocutione, or by approximation.
