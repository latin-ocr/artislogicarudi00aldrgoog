nc Innucrro.

sometimes called secoodnry camme οι· principles,
sometimes lcws, sometimes (sili) forms.

But this distinction can scarcely be considered
correct. lt is highly probable, if not certain, that
those primary axioma, which have been esteemed
intuitive, are in fact acquired by au inductiva pro-
cess: although that process is less discernible,
because it takes place long before we think of trac-
ing the actings of our own mindo. Itis certain
that it is often found necessary to facilitate the
understanding of those axioms, when they are first
proposed to the judgment, by illustratione taken
from individual cases. But whether it is, as is
generally supposed, the mere enunciation cf the
principle, or the principle itself, which requires the
illustration, may admit of a doubt. It seems pro·
bable, however, that such illustratione are nothing
more than a recurrence to the original method by
which the knowledge of those principles was ac·
quired. Thus the repeated trial or observation of
the necessary connexion between mathematical coin-
cidence and equality first authorizes the general po·
sitiou or axiom relative to that subject.¹ lf this
hypothesis is correct, it follows that both primnry
and ultimate principles have the same nature, being
aliha acquired by the exercise of the inductiva
faculty.

induction bears some analogy to «moceria».
Both of them commeuce with individuale, and pro·
ceed, hy successive comparisons, from these to ge-
nerals, aud from those things which are less general
to those which are more general. But there is this
essential difference between them: Abstrocticn is
simply an instrument of classificatiou, and relatas
to the formation and arrangement of notione: and
the adoption cf words to express those notione:
whereas Induction is an instrument adapted to the

discovery of lawe and principles previously unknown.
