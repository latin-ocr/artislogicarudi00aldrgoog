3. The remaining class of the fallacies which come
under the denominetion os the petitio ptinoipii is
thet which is commonly called orpuinp in o circle.
This occurs when, in a series of arguments, that
which had previously been inserted from cny prin·
ciple or lect is subsequently adduced in proof cl
that same principle or fect.

‘⁶ The argument that heavy bodies descend be·
cause they have gravity‚ aud again thet grevity is a
quality by which henry bodies descend, is an im-
pertinent circle and proves nothing.” (Glauci.)

This argument, The exterior angle of every tri·
ample must he greater tiron either os the two interior
opposite angles separately, becennest t's equod to both
together.- may in itself he sound and velid. But to
one who hes acquired the knowledge of the theo·
rem, that the ectetnnl angle is equod to butt tlte
opposite interior cupies together, hy the process by
which Euclid proves it, the argument would be a
circle. For he has first proved cn independent
principles that the exterior angle ir preater thau
either of tlte interior opposite angleer eud hy this
(through an intermediate process) arrives nt the
further truth of its equolity to tlte two conjoirttly.
