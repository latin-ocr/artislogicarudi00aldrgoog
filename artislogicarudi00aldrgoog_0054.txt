common to them ell. Reoerring therefore the
original process, we divest these classes also oi their
respective differences‚ and distinguisb the notion
comprehending oll the qualities in which they ere
similar to each other, by the nante boort. lo the
nme manner hare been acquired the notione de·
noted hythe words, bird, fieb, inseci, dec. lf again
we compare bird, fieb, beart, insectr by asimilar
operation of the mind, we arrive et the more ab·
suaet notion expressed by brute. But in all brutos
we may discover certain qualities which likewise be·
long to cor idea ol mon. Laying aeide therefore the
notione os reason, speech, and other differeoces, we
retain only the ideae belonging to the common na·
tore, viz. body endned with life. sensatione, and spon·
torreoue notiore, which we call by the common nante,
enimn. After haring by continued abstraction ob-
tained the idea oi animal, end the idea oi plant:
leying aside the notione oi sensatione, motion, dre.
andei beipltt, colonr, &a and only retaining the
notione of body, life, nonnisltment‚ protolli, dre.
which animels bare in common with plante, we
obtain the abstract idea tc which we affix the corn-
nron name, livinp body. By a similar process we
gain the idea ci body, by dropping the notion oi lise,
pronti, dic. and retaining those of reparate existence,
eote, dre. which belong to rocks, metcls, liquide, dre.
Thence, hy the comperison oi these abjecte with
euch others as are denoted by the words, sorel, onqei,
dre. divesting each of their characteristic proper-

preeeed hythe term substance. And lastly, as the
highest step, ne compare snbstonces with qnalitr'eo,
aod laying aeide the consideration that the one close
can aod the other cannot subsist independently cf
aoy other created object, we adopt the word being,

throp, or entity to denote the one action of pure

existence, and apply that poro to ell the clauos
