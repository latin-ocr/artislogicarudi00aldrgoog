to DE DIVISIONE.

Mnch cantion, indeed, is requisito to frama so ac-
curate a division, that no one subordinate class or
member shall intersere with another. Thus if a
classifioation of books be made according to their
subjects, into works of divinity, lato, orta ond sci·
encas, history, and helles-lettres ; it may be objected
that ecclesiastica! history may be indiscriminately ar·
ranged under the head of divinity or os history, and
yragneggorlagtrrl rhetogt'c nnderheither orte ond scieoces
or ‹rs-e es. amst t e customary gramma-
tical division of words or parts os speech, it may be
urged that prowourrs may be classed under the heads
olsuhstaotivesendadjectt'ves; participlesundereerbc
or adjectivae, interjectione under adverte, verbs, and
substatvtt'acs. A similar objection has been adduced
against the Linnaean arrangement of the vegetable
kingdom3 because every species which belongs to
the classes otottoecia, dioecw, and polyyomt'o, is re-
ducible to some one of the other classes. lt the
twenty-four classes ara represented as the direct end
immediate divisions of the general term Plorat, the
objection is valid, and may be extended to several
of the other classes also. But the more scientific
arrangement of Linnaeus removes the objection. For
he divides Planta, first, into those which hooc, and
those which hove not, ot'st'bIc stowers‚· (the phreno-
9omt'o aad cryptoqamiml the latter of which consti-
tutes hie twenty-fourth class. The former of these
he subdivides into those which hove, and those which
hove not, tho stamina ond pistils in tlte savae flowerr
(otonoclim'a and diclinio 5) the latter comprehending
the three classes already mentioned3 the former
further divided into those which have the stamina
separated or not separated. (difflues and affinem these
last being distributed into five classes; while the
former are again sub-divided into those which have
stamina ol indetetwrinote and those which have them

of determinate relative length ; these comprehending

the ¹fourteenth and fifteenth classes, and those the
first thirteen classes.
