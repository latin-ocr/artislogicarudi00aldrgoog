OPPOSITION E. 117

plaute are oryauiacd, Some plaute arc aot aryauired,
arefalse.

But if two terms are so related to each other,
that the quality or notion expressed by the predi-
cate cannot enter into the eubject; to ussat, either
universally or partially, that it doee belong to that
subject ie false3 whereas, to deuy it of the subject,
whether universally or partially, is true. Ther is,
¹0hildilid.ll¹lll⁵llil²ltilll}
is a malleablc substance, and that, Some praeite ie
malkuble: but it ia true that, No yrcrrite is mal·
leablc, and that, Some praeite ie reat molleablc.

Again, if any attribute or quality exista in one
portion of the individuale denoted by the rubjeot
and not in othere, it is falae either to assertor to
deny that predicate concerning the subject uui·
versallyr but to assertor deny it partially will be
trae. Thet is, in cattiuyeat matter, universal
propositione (A end E) are false3 particular pro-
positione (Ι and Ο) are true. For instance, itit

salse thet All hirdr cre rapaciour: but true that ι

Some airu ore rapaciores. lt is false also thot No
birds ure rapacibus, but true that Some birds ure
aot rapacium.

The application of these principles will illustrate
the rules or canons oi the several kinds oi opposition.

l. Contradictory oppositiou is that which rub-
siste between two pure categorical propositione,
differiug both in quantity and quality. lf therefore
the one ia universal affirmative, the other must be
particular negative: or if the oue is universal
negative, the other must bo particular affirmative3
and vice verra: aa, All meu are responsibler Some
men are act responsible. No soldiers are coacturus,-¹
Some soldiers arc cowards.

The oppositiou between contradictary proposi-
tione ir perfect ; since they differ iu every respect.
