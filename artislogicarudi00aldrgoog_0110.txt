PROPOSITIONUM SPECIES. or

lt moy occur that n proposition, which by itsell
would be rightly deemed negative, is in the course
of an argument employed affirmatively. lt, nt‘ter
haring laid down the lest position, it should be
added, Bet the neighbourioy willer ir not diehonert5
he therefore ooyht to be treated with confidenoe ,· the
former oi these two propositione must in this con·
· nexion he accounted affirmative, the negative particle
being used solely to qualiiy the term dishonert ,· as it
it were thus expressed, Eoeryteot-diohonest-mow ouyht
to be treated with confidenoe: bnt the treiyhbortrirry
milleris o not-dishonest-merr. The sentence, οὐδεὶς
drlgdm arar slew edre dunelm, is negative, if οὐκ is
considered as combined with the verb: it otherwise,
it is affirmative. (Herod. v. 56.)

ln this manner also every negative proposition may
be considered es affirmative; by connecting tlte sym-
bol oi negation with the predicate. For example,
the proposition, No speeies of worm hoe leyr or eoinyr,
may he thus enonnced, Eneey speeies effworm odes-
titrtte eff leyt and winyr. Some fruito ore-not pwlpmeer
Some politieol constitutions do not secure the liberty
<ff the nely'eet,· are equivalent to, Some fruito ore
notpnlpoeo, Some politieol constitutions ore consti-
tutions which do not secure the liberty of the roh'eet,
or, fail to secure the liberty of the mlyjeet.

Some propositione are of e mixed nature; con-
sisting os cn affirmative which oomprises o negative;
or of a negative comprising an affirmative. For
instance, Mon alone destroye those ty'hie oron species:
that is, both, Mon destroys hie own speeies ,· end, No
other erectores destroy thoeeof their own species. 1
