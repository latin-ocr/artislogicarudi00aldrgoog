grammate ostendere3 seque propterea non renr

illis vocabulo, Sylhgiemne scire sacient opud
Logicos vocatur Demonstratto. Cumque in
Scientid (siqua forte possibilitas, tamen) nul-
lus sit erroris metus3 quod hujusmodi Syl-
logismis‚ sive uno, sive pluribus probatur,

Demonstration consiste of a syllogistie argument,
or series of arguments, in which a conclusionis ne·
cesserily and evidently inserted, either immediately,
or, by the interventio noi intermediate truths, from
axiomatic and primary principles.

lt produces knowledge, that is, a clear perception
of end full acquiescence iu the thing demonstreted.
This perception and acquiescence may continue
when the demonstrative process in which it origi-
neted ie fotgotteu.

Demonstrative knowledge is theoretically superior
to that acquiescence which is called certainty, end
which proceeds from the highest class os probable
pronis. ln practice however it is osten found, thet
as strong a conviction is produced by these, in
the subjecte to which they arc appropriate, es by
demonstratiou. We may practicelly be es fully ond
as justly convinced nithe authenticity of the holy
Scriptures, as οἱ the equolity oi the angles oi an
equilaterel triengle.
