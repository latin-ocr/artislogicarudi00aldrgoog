ENTHYMEMA. 223

⁰f Sheateiah? Where ure the sonqs uod the natural

history of Soloinoo, or the Epistle from Laodicea?
But if the Protestaut has uot the whole Bihle, thot
which he has cannot be a sufficient ναῖε offoith to
him.” The question which the objector attempts to
prove is, that The Protectonts' Bible is not α suffi-
cient ναῖε ‹rffoith The immediate argument ad·
ranoed in support of this assertion is, that An imss
refrttttuuffis tellit*
fore the Protestaut Bible ῖεαοῖ a sufficient ναῖε os
saith. This argument is expressed in the above

sentence hy an euthymem containing the minor ,

premiss aud the conclusion. But the objector feels
that minor premiss to be too wealr to sustain his
argument. He therefore attempts to confirm it by
another fiction which constitutes the major premiss
of another syllogism: hemely, Whatever Bible does
not contuiti the bools ofJasher, Nathan, he. is αα
imperfect Bihle: hut the Protestant Bihle does αοῖ
contain the books ofJasher‚ Nathan, tle: therefore
the Protestant Bihle is αα imperfect‘Bihle. Thet
major premiss is not expressed3 and consequently
some readers would not at all advert to the meaning
οῖ the implied proposition3 while others would ac-
quiesce under the influente οῖ e kind of shame which
is osten felt at hesitating concerning that which the
author treats as an obvious and undeniable truth.
Again‚ the infidel urges, The New Testamertt was
not written et the date when it professes to have been
written, for it was never heard of until the Oowncil
os Laodicea. But the sallaey is detected by com·
pleting the syllogism; thus, No series of independent
traete or writiups cun erist before they are collected
into one booh end comprised under α commori title,-
the New Testament is a series of independeut trects
or writiopr; therefore the Nero Testameot did not
exist before it was collected into one boch uod com·
