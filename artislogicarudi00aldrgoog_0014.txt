§- 1. De Mentis operationibus. ⁴

MENTIS operationes ad ratiocinandum ed-
hibitae tres sunt. 1. Simplee ppprehensio.
2. Jodicium. 3. Ratiocioiom.

The office oi Logic is the developement os the
natural process of the homan mind in the ect of
reasoning. lt has therefore a close allionce with
that bronch οἱ Metephysics which reletes to the
inculties and operatione of the mind. These facul.
ties indeed, and their respective operatione, are so
dirersified, thot the enumeration oi them might be .
carried to en almost unlimited extent. But, if not

all, those nt least with which Logic is connected, ,

’ may he reduced to these three classes, Simple
Apprehonsioo‚ Jndpmer'tt, and Reosoninp. 'l’hev
act oi Reotoniop is, in iact, the subject-matter os
Logic; end to thie the exercise oi the other two
operatione are subordinate.

Ench of these words, Simple Appreheotion, ‚lodp-
meot, Reosonin9‚ is employed to denote the fdcnlty
or power of the mind; the operation or exerciee oi
thet faculty ς end the result of thot operation.
