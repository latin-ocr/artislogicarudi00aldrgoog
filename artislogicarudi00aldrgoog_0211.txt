198 DE REDUCTIONIS

Thus reduced to Ferio:

Instiacl is not reasaa; Some kind of natural
capacity is instincte Therefore same lind of natural
supaaty rs not reason.

Agelli ἶ Some acle ofsrieadslrip militate against jus·

lice;

Am All cols os friendslrip ap ar ciriacus and
splendid to lle thought ss : Thenfara

Is Scene things radioli appear oirluouc ond splen·
did to lla thoughlless militate against
justice.

'lhe significative consonents which effect these
. premises are s sud ra. The latter teoches that the
promises ere to be transposed. The former shows
thet the simple converse ol the major preruiss is to
constitute the new minor premiss. These changes
produce the following promises in the first figure
in Darii:

All acts offriendslrip appear oirlnous end splendid
to the theophiless: Some acts which militate apainst
justice are acts osfriendslrip. From these new pre-
mises the direct conclusion is, Some acts which rni-
litule aqainstjustice appear ciriacus aad splendid to
the thouqhtless. Ol which the original conclusion
is the simple converse; us the final s in Disamis
intimeted. Thus thet conclusion and the mode in
which it is drawn are shown to be valid.

Agellln' Tne passione are common lo brutos,-
Es The virtues are nol common lo drales:
lrEs Tae uirhres are nol passione.

Thus reduced to Celarent:

No qualities common to braces are cirinen The
passione ore qaolities common to brutos: Therefore
the passione are aot virtues.
