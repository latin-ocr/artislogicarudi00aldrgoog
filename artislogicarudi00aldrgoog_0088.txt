DE DEFINITIONE. 75

Definition. lt serves to rhew what notione ere to he
included, aud by inference what to he rejected, in
each word: and thus to afford‚ as nearly as possi·
hle, a precise understanding of its meaning. Even
thus, we can but imperfectly succeed iu acqniring
precision ; not only because, iu spite of the best
definition, the rnind will recur to the notions which
it has previously been accustorned to apply to any
particular term3 hut because the instrumento of
defining are still werdo, and therefore liahle rothe
same ambiguity as the term defined. This circum·
stance renders a single word wholly incompetenti to
sustain the office of a definition. A synonym may
explain, but cannot deiine a word. A combination
oi words affords a greater approximation to pre-
cision, because the ambignity of each is in some
measure corrected hy its connexion with the rest.
Brenthe definition of the term Definition, ns given
in the text, illustrares this ambiguity; since the
word' sentence is there employed, not in its common
use, as a combination of words containing and
relating to a finite verb: but, as Aristode often
uses it, for any combination of words, with or with-
out a verb.
