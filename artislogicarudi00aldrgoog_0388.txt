The sun aud the earth are both spherical bodies.
ls therefore they were equal in siae, the shadow of
the earth would be cylindrical, and extend od
infinitum. But if so, Mars, and the other superior
planels would be eclipsed by it. But this is never
the case : therefore theson aud the earth are not of
equal siae. Again‚ if the earth were larger than
the sun, its shadow would increase iu width in
proportion to its distance, and thus would occasion-
ally ecli se the superior planete. But the earth

would have made his pretended author promise at
the end of each Epistle that he would shortly pay a
visit.to those to whom the Epistles were addressed.
