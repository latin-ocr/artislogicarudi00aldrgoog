DE DEFINITIONE. 81

cogniaed, it is reeh· and belongs to its respective
class, whether logical, physicol, or descriptionol. But
if the intention oi the definition is simply to prevent
a misapprehension ol the precise meaning oi the
word, the same definitior is nominat.. Definitionis
ol the mental operatione, and, in general, of all
technical and scientibc terms, (as ol words used in
divinity‚ physics, mathematice, dec.) are for the most
part nominet: their object being only to avoid am-
biguity by stating in what sense each word will be
employed ; that is, ol what notione it is to be tho
sign. lf therefore one author defines conceptione
notiore of any object whether real or fictitiousr
another, α notion ercited bp unp object of sensatim,-
and another, α notion eccited by any absent object of
perception or sensation5 it cannot be asserted that
any one ol them is actually wrong in his defini-
tion; ior he merely states the meaning in which be
employa the word. But that writer will be deemed
most judicious wboee definitiou least deriates srom
the generally received application of the word. The
observatione and examples on nonne of secondory in-
tention, (peges 35-37.) will further illustrate tbe
nse oi nominal definitione.

Definitions derived from etymology are most fre-
quently, although not exclusively, nominol‚· being
usually adduced to elucidate the original import oi
the word defined: lor example,

Animal cni est anime.

Fides ita appellatum est, qnia fiet quod dictum est.

Ὀνομᾶζιτιι himer, ’ὅτι diga insin, ὅστις abr ὅ τις εἴποι

digeror, real ὅ Aramis, deguerit.

’Ananim cl nie arande< duplm.
