14⁶ SYLLoutsnss REGUIAE

the conclusion to be proved contains two ternis:
the process ol prool requires the comperison of esch
with n single additional term: nor is thore any roonr
lor the admissiou ol any more. Thus in tho follow·
ing syllogism the terms of the question sre unde,
and honestem,- ond tho torm ol comperison is ho·

mim·

Quod bonnm eet, id certe atile‚·
Quod haeream, id bonisne,⁸ Ergo,
Quidquid honestam id stile.

2. It is expedient that esch oi these terms should
he distinguished by nn appropriate name. The pre-
dicate therefore of the question or conclusion is de-
nominated the minor term or the major extreme,-
the subject of tho question or conclusion is cheminot
term or extreme: and the term oi comparison is
called tho middle term or medium. Thus in the
syllogism above given,

The major extreme or term, uamel y, the predicate
oi the question, is utile:

The minor extreme or term, nemely, the subject
ol the question, is honestam:

The medinm, or third term, is honam.

The distinguishing names, Major, Minor, and
Middle termo, nro derived from the comparative cx·
tentos sech, in most syllogismo which hove sn
universal affirmative conclusion. Thus, in the
syllogism‚ Whotever betrayse meonness is hatefitlfl ;
batflaeteryr betrayse meanneso: therefore flattery'·
is hatefnlM: the major extreme (rr), hotesul, is
more extensive in its application then the medium
(μ), whatever betrays memnone, which is only ooo
class oi things hotesal: ond this medinm is more
extensive than the minor term (¹¹¹), fluitem, which
is but one class of things betraying meanness.

lu tho following apparent syllogisnr there are
tour termo: Troe wisdorn cannot he too denrly ραν-
chased ,· Humilitn always accompanies trae nouom
