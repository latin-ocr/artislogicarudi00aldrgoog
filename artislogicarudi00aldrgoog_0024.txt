ἑ Α Word is eleo the sign osoootion or conception.
, The word Loodoo, or The odies city of Enylood, in·
, tiaratos thot the notion or conception ei the thing
j denoted by that word existe in the mind of the

speaker or writer, which he wishes te communicate
ξ to another by exciting a similar notion in lu's mind.

ἶ Α Word is usually considered to be nt once the
, sign of athingeodof enotion. But thesemny be
¹ separated. It may denote a thino without a corre-
sponding notice ,· as when we repeat that which we
ἰ do not understand. Or it may denote a notionz
without a corresponding thirty. Of this character
j are not only words expressing mere creatores ot the
l imagination, ae, fciry, priffim end those which de·
³ notenegative notione, cs, privatioo, inviwbitity: but,
ἵ os will botenster bs shown, cll terms which repre-
sent ebstract notione.

Agcin, a Word is a oicnrjous sign. lt not only
, (like e pointing suspended before e house of enter-
tainment) gives informationes the existence of the
thing denoted; but (like e bank note) it supplies
the place of thet which it represents. lt first do-
cteres tbe ideo or notion in the mind3 it then sets
that idea or notion in the place oi the object which
excites it; treeting the oetion and tbe rttny as if they
were one end the seme; and lestly, it is itself em-
ployed as a substitute both t'or the object, and tor
the idea which that object excites. Thus in the
sentence, London is tlte metropolis of Enylond, that
is said concerning the word London, which is in-
tended concerning the thing signified by that word.
Thus the expression is not less philosophicel then
poetic, “ Quosque soccos infaustum interluit Allia
uomew.” OEn. vii. 717.)

Lastly‚ a Word is cn arbitrato sign. lt nequires
its signification only trorn mutual compact. There
is not any natural fitness io the sounds or forms
which constitute any word (except in some teu·
which are formed by imitation) to express either
