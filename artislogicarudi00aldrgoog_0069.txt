56 DE SPECIEBUS

or most speciflc species. Every cognate term may
be universnlly predicated of it; bnt it cannot be
predicated in the same manner of any cognate term.
For example; it is true that all lions are quadrupedo,
are beasti, archontes, are animale, are corporeal, are
substances, ere organized, are helops.

All the intermediate notions, (as well as the
words which represent them) ere called subaltero.
Like the subaltern officere in an army, or the inter·
mediate steps oia ladder, ench is nt once superior to
some, and inierior to othere. anh may be employed
as the predicato comprehendlng some less abotraot
cognate terms; and ao the subject included in some
more abstract cognate terms; each is a gertus in
relation to some lower speciem and a specior in
relation to some bigber genera. Thus the word orti-
mol‚ which is a suboltorn term, may be predicated of
some of its cognate termes (ae, all lions, nll qna-
drupedt, all denoto, all marcomannicam) and may
also form a subject of which other cognate terms ,
may bepredicated3 as, all animale are endued with '
lise, are corporeah are substantes, ‘are heloys. ln
relation to these terms of which it is the subject, it
bears the character and name of a species: in rela-

, tion to the former, of which itis predicated‚ it bears

the character and denomination of a genart.

This may be illustrated bya scale somewhat si-
milar to that which was adopted by Porphyry lor a
different purpose, and which has acquired the name
of Arbor Porphyriena. ln this scale Eos vel Res is
the highest genus: Homo the lowest species: the
other terme in the same oolnmn are subaltern terms.
On the left hand arethe logical differenccs which
distinguish each species from the collateral species
belonging to the genus immediately above it: on
the right hand ere the differentes ol those collate·
rnl species which are not speoified in the scale.
