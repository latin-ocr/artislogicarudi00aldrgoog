216 ENTHYMEMA.

lt ie most frequent, in enthymema to express
the minor premiss3 since this is usually ruore liahle
than the major premiss to he called in question.
The major premissis usually a proposition of a
more general nature, aud is therefore supposed to be
better known, and less exposed to contradiction or
doubt.

For instance: We enjoy a preater depree of poli-
tical liberty tlon any civilized people on earth, and
can therefore lane no escuresor a seditione disposilion.
The major premissis here understood; These who
{t a entitltltt't‘’eltl'ttlll‘ltllt’yt”t
seditione disposilion.

Tire paneros ridicule ir a dangeroas faculty ; since
it templs its possessor to find fault arp'astly, and to
distress sorae for tlte gratification of ollas. This
sentence comprehende two enthymems3 for there
are two middle terms. And the major promises
respectively implied in each are, Tiar which tempts
its possessor to find fault urpastlp ir a dangeruus
samrltp ; and, Tlat rolicl induces its misereor ta dir-
tress sornlp sor tle gratification eff others ir a danger-
oas acu .

TJcton hely ruho understand other languager are
competent to treet conectlp of tle principles of their
orum since sicel a competenop requires a philosophi-
calcient os tlte natare eff hngnage in general. Here
the major premiss is suppressed‚ and the sense of
the direct conclusion is more emphatically eonveyed
by the use of its contrapository or negative converse.
The syllogism is iu Barbara:

All nito lovea philosophical acquaintance raith the
penerel natureos language understand other lungaages

esrdes their own ;

All who are competent to treat correctl of tlte prin·
ciplrs os tlreir oron langaape lave a lilhroplrical ae-

paaintance raith tlte genera satureo language;
Therefore, all roho are competent to treot conectly
