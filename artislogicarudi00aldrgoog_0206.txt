DEMONSTRATIONE. lou

Bromnnts'p and Dimuris: the second to Fescpo
and fresone.- and the third to Camertes. The
terms oi the rulo shew that this ligure admits ol
no negative premiss unless it be universal, and of
no universal conclusion unless it be negative.
They shew also that this figure is oi little if any
practica} use.

Perfice igitur et revocari atque reduci dici·
mus indirectos, cum per modum aliquem di.
rectum illationis suae vim demonstrant. Et
definitur Reducto’m imperfecti modi in perfec-
tum mutatio, quo necessitas illationis fiat ex
inevidenti evidens. Fiet autem, quando eviden-
ter (h. e. in primis) ostenditur conclusionem
vi praemissarum vel l. talem esse3 vel ll. eham
esse non posse. Unde Reductio est vel oston-
sioo vel cd impossihile.

Reduction is properly defined, “ The change of a
“ syllogism in one figure into an equivalent syllo-
“ giem in another ligure.''

But that branch οἱ reduction which is employed
to demonstrate the validity oi the argument in the
latter three figures by an appeal to the principle of
the first figure is defined, ae above, “ The chang-
“ing an indirect mode into a direct mode, ior the
“purpose ol rendering erident tho necessity of its

‘⁶ inference.”
1. This reduction is ostensive or direct when the

new promises in tho first figure authorize either the
identical conclusion nl the original syllogism‚ or a
conclusion lrom which the original conclusion can

be legitimately inserted by conversion.
