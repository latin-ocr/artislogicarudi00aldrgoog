DE SYLLOGISMO. 1³9

sensu definiatur Sylngnmas: Oratio, in aad
parilis quibasdam atquc mareson, necesse est

alind euenire praeter et propter ea qaae posita
rant atque concessa.

Syllopism is a species of sentencer and is dis-
tinguished from all the collaterat species by the
logical difference, which is described iu the re-
mainder of the definition. The antecedent contains
principles which not only the person arguing lays
down as true, but ta which he supposes that those
to whom the argument is addressed will yield as·
sent. These principles, il not asseuted to, require
to be established by either syllogistic or other proof,
according to their nature. The conclusion· rn a
syllogism rs so closely related to tlre principles
premised as to be necessarily implied ιιι them3
yet it expresses a judgmeut totally distinct from
them To assert tlrat because na aaa men are prc-
fitable compaciens, tlrerrfirre na profitable compa-
aime are bad area, is not to syllogize; for the
conclusion rs not distinct from the proposition
whence it is deduced, but rs entirely involved
in it. The inference that tlre company os bad men
should be avoided, because a is perniciores, is syllo-
gistically drawn, for the conclusion, tlrc company
af bad men smila be accideris rs both preter and
propter, distinct from, and rendered necessary by,
the previously known premises‚ erateuer' rs perai-
