The quantity oi a proposition depende on the
extent in which its ruly‘eel is applied. li the sub-
ject signifies some one object only, the proposition
is rinpnlar. lf it is a word signilying many things,
(thet is, a common nouu,) aud is ro employed as to
denote them all, the proposition is universal. li the
subject signifies many, bnt is by some adjunot limited
to a portion oi them only, the proposition is porti·
oulor. lf the extent of the subjdht is to be known
only by the sense, eud not from the lorrn of the ert·
pressim, the propositionis indefinite.

tobe distributed or universal, when it is used in its

tiol, or particular.
