Two universal propositione may however bear
such a relation to each other as will authorine nn
more than a particular inierence: aa,

All tlte stors are more distant from os than we ore
from rte sun ,· But all tlte stare alred some depree of
lipht on tlte earth; Therefore some thinys which
shed a depree of teytt on the earth cremore distant
from ns than we orestem the sun.

An universal conclusion (all thinps which shed
eyter, dec.) would offend against the fourth rule,
by distributing the minor extreme when not dis-
tributed in its premiss. Yet, the true conclusion
(sonte titinys which shed eyter, dec.) might be drawn,
ii either ol the premises were expressed particu-
larly. As the argument stands, the minor premier
is exposed to the objection that there are probably
many stara the light oi which has not yet reached
the eartb3 which objection could not apply to itii
thus expressed;

Att the slors ore more distant from us then me ere
from tlte sun,· hui some (or many) stare rhed light on
the eorth; therefore some (or many) things which
alred light on tlte earth ore more distant from esthan

Particular terms vnry much in their extent. And
(on the same principle on which the conclusion must
not distribute a term which ie not distributed iu the
premias) it is inaccuratc to admit any particular
term in the conclusion in a more extensive applica·
tion than that iu which it had been employed in the
promise. li however the limitation be expresacd‚
the limited term assumes the character oi a singular
word. For instance,
