18 DE VOCIBUS.

it isan art. Viewed as that which tcaclrer to reason,
it has the character of arcierrce: viewed as something
to be done and not merely to be known ,· as relating to
practice, not to theory ; ithae the character of an
ort.

Every system or practice murt have a correspond-
ing theory: every art must have a science: but
when the theory or soience is simply subordinate to
practice, the term art is more frequently adopted,
unless any particular distinction is intended. Thus we

doing it has a still further object in view; tlte
direction of lhe mind in the acquisitione ond use os
knowled e.

lt mugst however be remembered, that Logic does
not profess to convey or communicate knowledge.
The folly of expecting from it more tban it professes
bas, by a natural reaction, become the occasion of
the low esteem in which many hold it. lt hasbeen
treated like some useful medicines‚ the advocates ol
which have so overruted their virtues as to induce
the cautious to reject them us altogether wortbless.
Logic may exercise the mind, but it cannot supply
