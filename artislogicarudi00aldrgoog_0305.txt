Geometriccl analysis and synthesis are not in
their nature different irorn physical or metaphysica}
analysis and synthersi. The analytical mode in
geometry consiste in commencing with a proposi·
tion which is ascertained by trial to he true in a
{iifl} lttyrrltptnttt: hillidii}
true, discovering what principles can be appealed
to in its prooi; tracing one step alter another
until the mind arrives at some known principle,
the truth oi which proves the correctness oi the
hypothesis. Thus if, without previous information‚
any one should perceive that in several practical
instantes the three angles oi a triangle hare
appeared to he equrd to two right angles, and should
be desirous to ascertain whether that equation may
be subsequently relied on as uniformly correct, he
would perhaps observo that the productiori of one
side of the trinngls forms with the adjacent side
angles equal to two right angles, one ol which is
one of the angles of the triangle. He would infer
that ii the onter angle could be proved equal to
the two others, his hypothesis would be established.
If previously acquaiuted with the propertics oi

should he equdl to one of ῑὶιοε remaining angles oi
the triangle‚ and the other to the other. Or ii
instead of producing a side, it should occur to him
to draw a straight line through one angulas point
parallel to the subtending side, he would discover
three angles which aro together manifestly eqnal to
two right angles, oi which one is an angle oi the
triangle, end the other two evidently shewn, by
the previously known properties oi angles formsd
