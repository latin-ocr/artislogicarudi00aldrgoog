286 INDUCTIO.

most, this representa only the final part of the pro-
cess. Tne essenos of the induction consiste, first,
in the accumulation of the individuale examined, so
aa to euthorine the assertion contained in the minor
premiss; and then, in the calculation oi probabilities
requisite to establish the major premitis.

The observation therefore of Aristone, that in·
ductionis priorin its nature to syllogism, appears
to be correct. Nor can syllogistic reasoning be
carried on to any extent without previous induction.

Yet this ecknowledged dignity and velue of in-
duction has no tendency to degrada the syllogistic
system. lt does not afford any sufficient reason
either for the omission of this branch of logic, or
for the universal study ol the inductiva system.
For though, theoretically‚ aa before observed, no
human testimony will authorize our admission of
general principles3 yet in fact the greater part of
mankind must rely on testimony. We are com-
pelled to act on the principle, (however incorrect it
is in theory,) eoique in steorte credendum Few
are competent to repeat the inductiva process oi a
Harvey, a Galileo,or a Newton; or to follow a
modern geologist in his researches over almost every
part of the globo. Few ere able even to peruse the
· history oi the phaenomena and experimenta which
others heve recorded, and thus, taking the laets
only ior granted, to deduce their own conclu·
sions. The majority, even of literary end scientiiic
meu, must be contented, on most subjecta, with a
superficiei knowledge; merely taking upon trust
the general results, without any acquaintance with
the train ol observation and discovery on which
they were originally founded. And the case is

similar in respect to moral induction. Our own
opportunities os observetion are limited; wc must
continually rely, in practice, on the counsele and
opinianus of others on subjecta of moral and political
expe rency.
