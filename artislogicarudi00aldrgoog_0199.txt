186 DE MODORUM

¹ general principle to a subordinate case. It is, ior

instance, a general principle in which most persons
will acquiesce, that, No system colticis is impractica-
dle in o larpe communityis intended to be of uni-
versal odlipation. But, the system of community
of poods is an especial case subordinate to tbe sub-
ject laid down, namely‚ Systems impracticoble in a
turpe community. The original principle will there·
iore be correctly applied to it3 namely, Community
of poods is not a system intended to be os universal
odlipation.

The fundamental axium oi tbe first figure is
usually thus expressed: “ Whatever may be either
“ affirmatively or negatively predicated oi any uni-
“ versal or distributed term, may be predicated in
“the seme manner (that is, affirmed or denied re·
‘⁸ spectively) concerning every thing comprehended
“ under that term.''

Thus if the quality or attribute implied by the
word habits is affirmed of att virtues universally;
and il prudente, or justice, or benevolente, or po-
tience, or temperance, is comprehended under the
term virtues then habits may also be affirmatively
predicated of each oi these. The syllogism there-
fore will be in this form;

All virtues are labiim

Prudenee [or, justice, or beneuolence, or patience,
or temporanee] is a uittae:

Therefore prudence [or jrtstice, or benevolente, or

patience, or temperasse] is a habit.

Agiria, iu the following syllogism,
Quod botrum, id certe utile;
Quod honestum, id donum ,· Ergo
Quidquid honesturn. id utile:

The rhajo extreme utile is, in the major premiss,
predicated universally and affirmatirely ni bonum:
but tlte minor term honestum is declared iu the
minor premiss to be comprehended under donum:
