subordinate parts and minutiae of a narrative helps
much to establish the probability of it. An appa·
rent varianae between circumstances which on close
examination appear compatible‚ affords aleo a very
strong confirmation to the credibility oi the wit·-
ness: such particulare being out of tbe probable
reach of collusion.

1f a witness in whom these qualifications exist
is confirmed in his declaratione by the concurrent
testimony ol other unbiassed and independent wit·
nosses ·, il his personal enemim, or those uniriendly
to tbe disclosure of the laets or interested in the
suppression of them, corroborate his testimony; is
his testimony is made public and yet not disproved
or denied; all these aad similar circumstances,
added to the former, raisc the probability to the
highest degree, and entitla it to the denomination
ol certainty.

UERTJTUDO eadem videtur, quoe impro·
prio vulgo dicitur Euidentio Metabo,- quaeque
iis convenit effatis, de quibus nemo prudens
dubitaverit: qualia praesertim sunt Principio
ad vitam moresque pertinentia, cum conclu-
sionibus quae ab his legitime deducuntur. Nam
hujusmodi propositiones videntur esse plus-
quam probabiles, nondum tamen evidentes:
neque enim eas quisque amplectitur quam-
primum apprehendit3 sed iis prudens sine
ulla formidine assentitur.

certitudo duplex est; alia Oly‘eola quae est
