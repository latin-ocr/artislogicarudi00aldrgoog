SORl'l'ES. 241

3. All beingr endocd erithream beor the hum

gods beor the humonsorm.

In this enalysis, the first two propositious ol
the sorites, transposed, constitute the premiset of
the first syllogism. The conclusion from these pre-
mises forms the minor premiss oi the wcond syllo-
gism3 the major premiss of which is the third
proposition of the Sorites. The conclusion oi this
second syllogism forms the minor premiss os the
third, while the major premiss consisto ol the
fourth propositiones the sorites, which is here the
lest of the antecedent. This is therefore the last
syllogism, and its conclusion is the insereuce of the
whole Sorites.

The Sorites may be analysed iu another method‚
by taking the propositions of tho antecedent in a
retrograde order: thus ;

l. Whntever is endued with reason bears the hemon
form ,· Every virtoous being s's endued with reason ;
Therefore, every virtuoos hang beers the hemon
form.

2. Every virtuosos being beers tlte human sorm;
Whatever is happy is virtuous ,· Thereforn whatever
is happy bears the human form.

3. Whoteoer is happy hears the lacman forna
rte pods ore heppy‚· Theresore‚ tlte pods bear tlte
human form.

According to this method‚ the proposition lest iu
order in the antecedent oi the Sorites is the major
premiss of the first syllogism3 and the proposition
immediately preceding the last, is its minor premiss.
The conclusion of the first syllogism constitutes a
second major premiss, to which the lest proposition
but two, of the Sorites, affords a minor premiss:
