sis, immortale nc goras odium.

l. ln an errthprncm, the conclusion is drawn from
two promises, os which only one is expressed. lt
is, as to torm, a defective syllogism, in which the
writer or speaker relies on the common sense of his
reader or hearer to supply the suppressed premiss.
Hence it is ssid that the antecedent consiste of e
proposition and a judymeot: thetis, ol one premiss
expressed and the other implied.

Ercry cnthymem contains the three terms ol the
syllogism which it represents. One ol these terms
(condy, one ol the extremes of the question) occurs ‹
twic03 the middle term and the other extreme are
esch expressed but once. The suppressed premiss
is to be supplied by comparing with the middle term
that extreme which occurs only once.

For example: Tdc homan scol ir immorarier.-
corrrcqocntly it ir immortol. Here the conclusionis,
rte roman root ir immortol. The minor extreme
is, tlte horson rool5 which term also occurs in the
tttttlltdtalhltlsstlltrittld
minor extrue is compared with the middle term
immototol. The major extreme is immortalr and
the suppressed propositionis, Eoerp thirty immo·
torol is immortol. The complete syllogism thers-
tore is in Barbara: namely‚

Evary thirty immaterial ir immortol ,·
But the damon conl ir immateriale
therefore the hamon roni ir immortal.
