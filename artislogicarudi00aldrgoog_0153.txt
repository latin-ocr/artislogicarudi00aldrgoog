i. e. qui constat tribus propositionibus de
inesse. E quibus duae priores sunt Antece-
dens, tertia Consequens3 quae extra syllogis-

The classificetion of Propositions according to
their substance hasbeen described on peges 91-94.
But since propositione are the instrumente by which
deductiva reasoning is carried on, Syllogisms admit
tlte earne arrangement; namely‚ into (i.) Cate-
gorical Syllogisms; and these either (l.) Pure, or
(2.) Modal: and (ii.) Hypothetical Syllogisms;
which are either (l.) Conditional, or (2.) Disjunc·
tive.

The Hypothetical Syllogisms will be treated of
hereafter. The second class of Categorical Syllo·
gisms, called Modal, ere of little use, and are suffi-
ciently explained hythe observatione already made
concerniug Modal Propositions; (peges 93, 94.)
The subject of present consideration is the Pure or
Simple Cateporl'cal Syllopism; so called because it
is composed of three pure categorical propositions.

Of these propositions the first and second are con·
sideted as previously known and allowed. These
therefore conjointly constitute the Antecedent. The
third proposition is the result inserted, and is there-
fore called the consequent or conclusion.

This conclusion may present itself‚ unsought·for‚
to the mind, from the mere force of the antecedent.
But it is more frequently a topic of enquiry previously
set before the mind iu an undecided form, to be
affirmed or denied hythe judgment according to the
force of arguments to be discovered or advanced.
The topic thus presented for reflection or discussion
is sometimes called the problcm,· by mathematicians
