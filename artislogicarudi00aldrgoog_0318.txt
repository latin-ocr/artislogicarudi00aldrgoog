, 1. Fallacia aequiuocationis, sive nata ex voce
reculcare: ut, Carris est aalma& Sirius ast
carrie; Ergo, Sirius est animal. ln hoc qua-
tuor sunt termini; quorum duo, vox cante
aequivoce sumpta.

The term sallacy of equivocation is not confined
tn those fictitious arguments which involve a word
absolutely equivoca13 but comprehends every argn-
ment in which the same word is employed in different
shades ol sense. The use of a word in two different,
although analogons, sensas, when the sentence pro·
sesses to speak oi the same thing, is actually 'an
equivocation.

A sophism arising from this error is involved in
the argument, Every priest must have a real sacrifice
to offer: but tlte appointed administratore of rte
werd and sacramente of Christ ore priests: these
therefore masticare c real sacrifice to offer. F or the
word priest in the major premiss applies only to the
iuria or offeret oi sacrifices: whereas the same word
in the minor premiss denotas the perfectly distinct
office of the agwytbrrgoe‘ or presbyter of the Christian
Church. The apparent analogy between them, (in-
asmnch as they both denote the ministers in sacred
things) tends to confirm the misconception occa-
sioned by the homonymy.

This species of fallacy cannot be well exemplified
by arguments expressed in short sentences, and in a
form approximating to that oi a regular syllogism.
For under these circumstances, the absurdity is
usually so mariiiest, that the mind is ready to infer
that none could be misled by sophismsoi so gross and
palpahle a character. lt is in the course of length-
ened discussion, that a change in the application of
a word or expression is tacitly introduced; while the
delusion is conceaied from the careless or unpractised
