degree ofpleosure. But Burke employa the word to
express tle sensatior which accomporvios tle removal
<ff poia or danger. This then is a limited, naw-
ruodelled‚ philosophical, secondory intention.

ln like manner every author has a right to ap·
propriate any word to a new secoodory intention ; by
strictly defining the whole number of ideas which
he intends to represent by that word; and by aiter·
wards adhering closely to the same use of it. Such
a process is however never expedient, unless in a
case of necessity. Locke has done this in regard
to the word jedgmevvt, which he defines The pulling
ideas together, or reparating tlemsvom one another in
tle mind, when their certain agreement or dieagree·

ment is not perceioed, but preeumed to be ro. Pro·
«sessor Stewart and others have affixed a new se·
cond'ary sense to tho word conception; by limiting it
to Tlar ev ff tle mind which enables ir to form a

Xenophon represents thet an officer at tho table ’
oi Cyrus complained oi some of his brother-offieors,
because they had either invented or coloured the
anecdotes which they had related, for the purpose
ol exciting laughter; and charged thern with being
ἆλιζὸης. Cyrus defends them by asserting that he
misapplied that word by using it in too vague and
extensive a sense. ln the mouth of this officer it
was therefore a word oi primory intention. Cyrus
proceeds to assign its secundary intention thus: ‘0
μὲν pel< α’λαζῶν ἵμοιγι doerilvepe utivles ivel τοῖς προσποιου-
μξιοις εἶναι vel πλουσιωτέροις ii rivi, real elrdgurvlgwe, eorl
servisset ἃμῖι ἱκανοί vlo-w ὑπισχνονμένοις· real sabroe, dle·

ιεςοῖς γιγνομένοις, ’ὅτι τοῦ λαβεῖν τι llas eal erglrlvru aer·
οὖσιν. Yet the sense in which the officer used the

word coincides with that which Aristotle assigns as
its secondory or philosophical signification: tonet
μὲν ἄλαζῖυυ πςονποιητικὶς rr'iv ivllim river, vel pl bertegis·
ver, val μειζὸιων ἢ ὑπάρχει.
