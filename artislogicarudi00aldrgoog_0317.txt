aot , ''FALLAOIAE

The division into Verbol and Materia! Fallaciae
is by no means clear and satisfactory. The two
classes are so nearly allied to each other, that in
many cases the sanie fallacy may be arranged in
either of them. The seventh, eighth, and ninth
classes, ior instance, here (more appropriatelyyenu-
merated as fallacior os diction, are classified by
Aristotle and most subsequent writers among the
fallacias astru dictionem. r

The subordinate classification is also open to
abjectiori. lt may be doubted whether the catalogue
is sufficiently copious to include every fallacious
argument. And it is often difficult to ascertain
under which class any particular fallacy should be
located. This difficulty, however, often arisae, not
from the lauit of the enumeratiou, but because the
argument actually comprehendo more than one kind
of error. And the object of the classibcation is not
merely to attain a scientific arrangement, but to
excite the mind to vigilance by rendering it pre-
viously aware of the more prevalent methods oi
fictitious reasoning.

FALLACIAE dictionis, (extra eas quas snpra,
p. 145, 151, 155. indicavimus,) sive ex ancipiti
Medio Termino natm, novem esse videntur.

lt hasbeen already shown, (peges 147, 151.) that
ambiguity, either in thermiddle term or in either oi
the extremes, destroys the validity of a Syllogism.
Most of the Follooies cys diction are merely instantes
of that ambiguity under different forms.
