FALLAGIARUM SPEOIES. ³01

ln examiniog the soree and eccuracy of an ar-
gument, the first step is to acquire a clear aod
definite understanding oi the question to be proved3
and laying asida whatever is added ior the purpose
of illustrating or enforcing it, to express that ques·
tion as simply and briefly as possible. The entire
argument should then be retroced, so as to discover
with precision what ie the notion which affords the
hinge, as it were, oi the argument, or the term of
comparison with the two extremes oi the question.
When this is ascertained, it remeius to reduce the
premises to the form of a regular Syllogism. ln so
doing it will frequently be found that only one of
the promises is actually expressed3 and that even
that expressed premiss is intermingled with matter
which is merely illustrative; or that it is so vaguely
expressed as not to suggest to the mind, on the first
consideration, its real bearing, being only glaneed
at rather than actually stated; or that some sen-
tence implying the intended premiss, or intended aa
confirmatory of it, (arrd thus supplying the place
ol a prosyllogism) is substituted for the premiss
itself.

When the argument has been thus reduced to
form, its validity must be ascertaiued by an appli-
cation of the principles already laid down and illus·
trated.
