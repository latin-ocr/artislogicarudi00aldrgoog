each book of the holy Scripture depend on a traiu
ol probable procis, which when combined amount
to absolute certainty. The great and fundamental
fact of Christianity, the resurrection of our blessed

jective certainty denotas the impression made on
the mind: namely, that state of mind in which it
leels free from doubt on any subject. The mind
often feels certain ol that which actually is not
certain. The influence of early associatione, the
authority of eminent men, the opinions of our
aucestors, general consent, the lively manner in
which a subject has been first brought before the
judgment, too great haste and too little. cautious
