220 ENTHYMEMA.

But the acts of those toho hane attained the hiph-
est depree of excellence and whom me can with least
reason hope to snrpass are performed with the preat-
est apparent enses

Therefore the acts of such persons are the most
powerfal excitaments to emulation.

2. The usual form of aa enthymem is that of a
complex causel sentence. But its iorce is often
concentrnted into one simple grammatical sentence:
which is denominated an enthymematic sentence.
Thus the single proposition, The enample of Virpil
shetos that evena preat poet may he seduced into
some faults hythe practice of imitation, represents
the following syllogism in Darapti.

Virqil roas reduced intofaults hy imitations

Virpil was a preat poet ,· Therefore

Some preat poet has been mduced into saults oy
imitation.

Agninz‘ The apparent inmffleiencp as every in-
dividual to his own happiness or safety compels
us to seeh from one another assistance and support.
This appears nt first sight to be no more than a
simple proposition. But it involves nn argument:
it consiste in the application of a general principle
to a particular case. lt is equivalent to,

All heinys which are manifestly insufficient to
their own happiness oe· safhty are compelled to sech
from ench other assistance ond support: But every
individual os the human racc is so: Thorcfore every
individuul ie compelled to sech mutual meistance and
support.

Thus Nehemieh's question, Shorrld such a mart
as I fles? involves the following argument: They
roho are raised up hy Divina Prouidencc to accom-
plish a preat and bntefieial undertaking should not
he ready to flee from the appearance os damper: hut
sacham 1, I ought not therefore tostae.
