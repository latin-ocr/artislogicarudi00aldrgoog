4. Indefinite Propositions, having sor their
subject a common term without any sign either of
universality or of limitation‚ are ambiguous as to
their extent. They courcy no intimation whether
the subject denotes attor a part only of the indivi-
dual things to which the word is applicuble: as,

Amore imprecer mare by reading the story cf a
person emineat sor prudente aad cirtae, than ry the,
fiaert rules qs morality.

lapses aad inadverteaciee, are irfinitely preferable ta
the arare eeact aad correct roorlcs cf aa inferior
author.

Errare are maris osinfirrnity.

Errare crecp iata theineri prudent undertakings,

Such propositions are ambiguous, auditis the
office oi common sense, guided by sn acquaintance
with the branch of sciense to which the proposition
relatos, or the connexion in which it occurs, to de-
cide upon the extent in which the subject is to be
taken. One of the quatinus, ior instance, which is
above predicated oi erroro, namely, that they are
marles of irrfirrnity, belongs to the subject univer
salty: forali errare are such, The other predicate,
however, creep in to the mast prudent unmahteigs,
ceu only bs said oi some errors. This is therefore a
particolar proposition, the former is universal.
