glo or individual object. Such a term cannot be di-
nided, either by classilication‚ or by enumeration, be·
cause that which it signifies is only numericully one.

Esery thing which actually existe is singular, and
is therefore capable of being expressed by a singular
sign or word. But there objects are so numerous,
that it would be burdensome and useless to appro-

ideas, which are excited by the qualities in which
they appear to coincide with euch other. ‚When we
proceed, by a further mental process, to consider
the abstract notion thus acquired, as indiscrimi-

the individuale from which it was derived, and to all
others which comprehensi the same qualities‚ we are
said to peaerolize. From the former process the
motion criden thus acquired is denominated an ab·
