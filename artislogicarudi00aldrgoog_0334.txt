reasmn and hare knowledge about particulare: where-
as the immediate object ol all our reasoning and
knowledge is nothing but particulam. . . . So that the
perception of the' agreement or disagreement ol our
particular ideas is the whole and utmost of all our
knowledge. . . Universality is but occidental to it...
But the perception of the agreement or disagreemeut
oi any two ideas, consequently our own knowledge,
is equally clear and certain, whether either or both,
or neither ol these ideae he capable of representing
more real beings than one, or uo.” First, he ern-
ploys the word particularia the colloquial oense of
singulos, instead ol tbe logical and correct applica-
tion. And then, misled by bis own mistake, he
supposes that he overthrows the position which he
controverti: whereas the conclusion which he drawa,
namely, tlrat two singular premissa moy bc conclusive,
is quite consistent with the statement that no
reasoninp is conclusive ulrich las not ot least one
universal, (or, as he calls it, general) proposition in
ir: because singular propositione are virtually uni·
rersal.
