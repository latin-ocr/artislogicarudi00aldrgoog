individuale belonging to each species.

So a system of optics may naturally commence
with definitione and artiores, or the simple principles
ucenained by inductien: end proceed by the appli-
cetion of them to propositione dependent on them,
aud from these propositionem othere successively
demonstreble by means of them.

'l'he geologist introduces his subject with general
remarks on the structure of the earth and the
character end order of the strete, together with e
statement of the hypotheses on which his system is
founded, which he illustrates hy those exemplet
from which he hed first begun hie series of dis-
coveries, end derived those very principles.

to their mixed state as actually found in the ore.
ln purening this course he arrives by synthesis

lt appears then that the original discoverer of
eny seleuce, or the philosopher vvho desiree to
improre it by fresh discoveries, must adopt the
hmhytic method. But in communiceting the science
to others, either method may be adopted. The
analytic hes some advantages, inesmuch es it
makes 'the student n partalrer, ee it vvere, in all the

interest of the discovery. But the synthetic mode is
nore universally edapted for this purpose, es it dis·
