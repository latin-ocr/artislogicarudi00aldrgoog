3:30 FALLAOIAE

miss and the inference are ro nearly equivalent, that
the former is little different from a variety of ex-
pression for the latter.

An arguar will often endeavour to make his oppo-
nent appear guilty of this fallacy. And it may also
occur, that in consequence of the different degrees
of general discernment, or of acquaintance with the
subject under discussion, those propositione will
appear to one person almost identicel, between
which another may perceive a real distinction.

Such a deficiency of discernment appears to have

under difference of expressions, or the conversion
of tlte propositione, or both unitedly) aad that rir-
