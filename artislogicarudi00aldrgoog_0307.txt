the custom ol reduoing every thing to dichotomies
must be the occasion of great imperiection and
deficienoy; unless the strictast attention is paid to
make one terro ol each division, intactis not iu
form, the mere exclusive ol the other.

2. The divisione should be collateral, or imme-
diately belonging to the same genus. Thus it
would be absurd to adopt tbe following method for
atrestise on Logic: l. Os simple Terms,· 2. Of
Judgmentr 3. Os Celegericol Syllogismr5 4. Os

Hypotlteticol Sylloyisms‚ &c The lest two classes

two should form subdivisione. See Cicero's com-
ment on Epicurus’s division of derives, page 72.
, and the observatione on page 73. in relation to the
arrangement of his treatiso dc Officiis

3. Digressions, even though they may be in*
teresting in themselves, are injurious to the unity
of a treatise. ln some cases they ere unavcidable;
but they should then be as briei as is consistent with
perspicuity, and the transition to tho leading topic
should be distinotly marked. Otherwise the mind is
distracted, and the train of argument or ol narrative
is obscured. Even illustratione should be employed
with cantion, lest they draw off the thoughts from
the mein subject. The use of notes at the bottom of
, the page or at the end ol tbe work requires the same
cautious as that oi digressione in tbe body o'f a work.
They break the thread of tbe text, and destroy much
of the enjoyment if not of the benefit to be derived
from the regular and uninterrnpted discussion ol
the subject.

4. There should be a mutual dependence or natu-
ral sequence ol tlre parter each bearing a closer con·
nexion with that immediately preceding it than
