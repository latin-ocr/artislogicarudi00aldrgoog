probable or presumptive evidence.

acquiesce iu the probability of any thing, when it

ples already received as probable.

The most frequent aud almost universal indirect

mode by which it is possible to ascertaiu the pro-
bability or truth ol facts which have not fallen
under our own observation. And as to principles
and penerel conclusione, although testimony is not

Cuique t'n sud arte credendum. Even the philoso-
