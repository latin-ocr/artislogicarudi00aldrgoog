DEMONSTRATIONE. leo

This process is denomineted Reductiort. It is
usually applied to the purpose of demonstrating the
correctness of the consequence (that is, the real dc-
pendence of the conclusion on the premises) in the
modes of the three latter figures. And the evidence
which is thus afforded is undoubtedly satisfactory.

lt is not however the only or the primary evi-
dence of the correctness of these modes. Much
less can it be supposed that they ere in themselves
less accurate forms of argument than those in the
first figure; or that their conclusions are authorized
only because they imply certain corresponding forms
in that ligure: although this erroneous apprehension
has given occasion to the names imperfect, indirect,
end inevident, hy which they are usually distin-
guished. If indeed such a distinction were founded
on truth, the first figure would always be the most
natural form of an argument, which is not the case.
The following argument, for instance, is in the
second figure, in Comestres ,· a form of very frequent
use; The real culprit lras α deep scor oa tis left
etech· dut tlte prisoner at tlte har tas reo such merle,
aad therefore is not tlte real cnfprr't. But it can
scarcely be supposed to owe its correctness to the
fact that its promises imply either of the following
syllogisms, in the first figure .·

No man wito dos a deep scor oa lis lest cheek is
tlte prisoner at tlte bar:

But tlte recl culprr't hos o deep soar on his left

Tfterdgkoerepk ,tlte real cutprit is aot tlte prisoner ot
t e or,-

which conclusion implies its converse,
fheresore the prisoner at tlte har is aot tlte real
culprit.
Or thus:

Noae hut a mon todo lras a deep scor on his lest
cfeelt is the real calprit ,·
