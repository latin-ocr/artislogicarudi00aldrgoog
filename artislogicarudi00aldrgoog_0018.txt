By the operation oi Judgmeut the intellectuali

faculty compares any two objectu, and decides on
their mutual agreement or disagreement. Thnt is;
the mind judges either that its notiones one object
comprehendo the notion of another object, or that the
one is uueourtected with the other. Or, in other
words, it decides that the latter ie a quality or
attribute vhioh belongs or does not belong to the
former. Thus, the judgment expressed by the
sentence, Attfairt is esseut, implies that the notion
expressed hythe word utrem is involved in the notion
oisnitit3 or that esseut isa quality attached to saith.
Hence itis ssid, (hy a vugue and inaccurate figure,)
that esseut agrees with saith. Agnis, the judgment
expressed by the sentence, subules ure uot fluitet,
consiste in the mental decision that the quality
denoted by fieb is not attached to subolet: or
thet the notion or apprehension expressed by the
word whole does not include the notion represented
by the word fieb. Tbese two objects are therefore
technically said to differ stom each other.
