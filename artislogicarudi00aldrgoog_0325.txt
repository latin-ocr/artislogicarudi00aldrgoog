shall pass by sach dnae: hot blech and white horsea
are devised,· therefore the plaintiff shall have the
pied horses. The middle term is ambiguous in con·
sequence of a transition from the distributed to the
combined sense. The real promises are, Both blech
horses ond h'hewise white horses ore beqaeathed,·

hat pied horses are horses conjointly blech ond white. .

They contain therefore four distinct terms.

An argument of this character has already been
adduced, (p. 223.) The New Testament is not the
productior aff Apostles or their cotemporories; for
it was first issned hy o coancil held three hundred

premiss a different term is substituted by theoseos
the same word in a distrihaeed or disided sense, as
denoting some persons attached to thot party.

The worhs of Pindar consisted of Dithyramhics,

those topics: therefore those poenas ore not the worhs .
of Pindar. Here the major extreme occurs in the
premiss in acollectioe sense, all the worhs ry'Pindor
toyether; and in the conclusion in a distributive
sense, for any of the separate worhs of Pindor.
