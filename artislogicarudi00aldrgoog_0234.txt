ΕΝΤΗΥΜΕΜΑ. 221

Again, the query oi the unbelieviug Pharieeer
was on enthymematio sentence: How eon o reon
thot ie o sinum do such mirocles? The following
syllogism represents the train ei thought which
suggested that question: Sincere nrc net eudued
from uhoec willo the power ef working mirocles: thir
mon is o nieuw: therefore he is not enducd reith
the pomer of workiuy mirocles. 'l'heir minor pre·
miss was false; aud therefore, (the consequence, er
connexion of the conclusion with the antecedent,
being correct) their inferente war also salse.

Demosthenes very loroibly compresses three ar-
guments into one enthymematic sentence, when, in
etirring up his country te espouse the cause of the
dementatio party in Rhodes against the aristocraoy‚
aud their ally the Queen ef Caria, he says,

Oris sirmio, sl ὑμιῖς, ἰἰτις Ἀθηναῖοι, βάςβαζοι r'irlqu.
ποι, sal rohos γυναῖκα, Poetelio-erte ς

Two arguments are emphatically contained in
tho following sentence:

Airgqo'r lero ἅρχων rt, ἵνα Ἀθηναῖοι, lithos-ermricus tol
Aasrlaapou'ur. (Anae.) Xenophon was but on indiui-
ducl, and he was au Athenium thir circumstance
would rander his authority obnoxieus to Lacedte·
meniaus; the former would render it equally ob·
noxious to all aooustomed to a popularet mixed
government. ,

The argument from the srailty ef humen nature
is very frequently thus implied in the poete, and
ether writers. For instance3 lignique δ’ ιὶτίζιιι oilie
c'lrlqurwr misr. (δορὴ.) that iu, dirigerer lure, er rim(
o'irtgnwo's ripe. Agaln‚ 'l'l quiq dpaqroirur, oirtqolrroes 'dr-
us, wille alpem isuper-sir. (Xen.) Συ sis oldas, diriguere
idn, sris χςῖι ri eluere. (Herod.)

The following are examples oi enthymems and
enthymematic sentences.

Reol leoruiuq is loo unluablc o thirty lo he within
the yrurp of the idle.
