previous operationes two judgments; irom which
another judgment isinferred. Hence it cannot be
fully expressed by iewer than three sentences. Thus

judgments, which if expressed will require the use

of these three sentences: First, Euery substance

sentence; Tbe eortb is spbcricol. This entire
process thus expressed in langunge is logically called
a decemplex or doubly complex word.
