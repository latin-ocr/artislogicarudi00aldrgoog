48 DE SPEOIEBUS

plurium essentiarum vel specierum pars com-
munis, de specie differentibus, h. e. de diversis
speciebus quas ingreditur, dici; ut animal de
· homine et orato. Speciem vero, de numero
differentibus, h. e. de diversis individuis, quo-
runr singula babent essentiam speciei vocabulo
significatam sichomo de Socrate et Platone
dicitur, et de omnibus, quibus natura inest
humana. Reliqua vero Praedicabilia, (prout
inferius patebit) eadem de causa, tam de specie
quarn numero differentibus dicuntur.

The Predioables belonging to each of these five
classes are predicated (or asserted in the same
sense) of many things3 namely, of all those objents
in which a nature corresponding with the notion
‘²⁹43thtltt⁰tl¹tz¹¹tt⁰ttl ‘ltin aeta
express common naturas derived not immediately
lronr the comparison oi individuale, but from the
comparison of several classes or species already
formed by abstracticn from individuals3 whence
they are technically said to be pradicated of things
differinp in species. ’

Those which belong to the class ol Species, since
they represent the general or common notion cf
some abstract nature conceivcd to exist in a number
of different individuale, are said to be predicated oi
things differing in number.

Those which come under the haads oi Differeace,
Property‚ and Acciderat, are said to be predicated‚
some of them, concerainy things differiny in species,
aad others conemiap things di ering ia number,
because they may hare immediate reference, either
tn a Genus, in which case they are predicated oi all
