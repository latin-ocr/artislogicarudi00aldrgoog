The serpent beguiled me, nod l did eet.” Such also
was the inrplied argument of Ahab when he thus
addressed himself to the prophet, Art tltoo lte that
troubletlt Israel? To which the prophet answers,
first, by denial, end then by essigning the true cause:
“l have not troubled lsrael, but thou and thy
father's house, in that ye have forselren the com·

mnndments of the Lord‚ end have followed Baalim.” ' ¹

(l Kiugs xviii. 17,18.)

wise explained3 namely‚ es a real conclusion drnwrr
from e false premiss.

The following argument is a non-sequitur. Pte
