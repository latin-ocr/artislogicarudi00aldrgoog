GENERALES. 159

medio, alterum differt: Ergo praemissarum al-
tera affirmat, reliqua negat.

l. A negative promiss most be followed by a*
negative conclusion. For it asserts the disagree·
ment between one of the extremes and the medium3
while the other promise, which must (by the pre·
ceding mle) be affirmative, asserts the agreement
oi the other extreme with the medinm. Thereiore
(by the second canon) the extremes disagree‚ and
the conclusion is negative. F or example,

No merc man is insollible ; now tlte pope is bnt a
mom therefore tie popo is not infallible.

⁵2. On the other hand, a negative conclusion can·
not be proved except by the nse oi one negative
promise, the other premiss being affirmative. For a
negative conclusion asserts the mutual disagreement
ol its extremes. And this disagreement can be
established only by means oi a middle term which
agrees with one of those extremes and differs from
the other.

li, ior example, the question to be proved is,
Pagonism is not a iormless evil, it is necessary to
adduce come medium which agrees with poponism,
and differs from n lormlcss evih- or, vice-versi, one
which shall agree with the latter, and differ irom the
former. The word, Whatever originales in n wilsati
departure from tlte itali, affnrds a middle term of
the former character3 the word, clar reiicit is oc-
casioned oy ignovonce alone, will serve for a medium
ol the latter description. On these terme respectively
arc founded the two following arguments:

It is nrfficicmly noidant thot pagoniam mast hooc
oripinntcd in o wilsnl deportare from tire iroth:
indeed, its heinonsness os incoloiny rte pnilt os prc-
