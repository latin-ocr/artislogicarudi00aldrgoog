DIVISIONIBUS. ³5

Qualities may be predicated ol the same subject
nt different times, which notwithstanding are oppo-
site, or inconsistent: for example, The wall which
to-day is white, may to·morrow be blank.

Relative terms are opposite, when their subject is
the same. Το be father and son ol the same in·
dividual is impossible. . That which is belf ol one
quantity may be the whole of another: but linis
and whole are opposite, or inconsistent, if applied in
relation to the same quantity.

contrary words are opposite, or inconsistentr aa
nuth, fulsedood,· happiness, misery.

Such also are a positive and a privative: as har-
moniovs, enharmonicas

But the strongest and most complete opposition
of simple terms subsists between a positive and a
nepotive word3 or a definite and indefinite term: as,
a seelinp man; an vnseelin9 roek; he is a deror he
is not altero.

Adistinetion munt be made between the logical
and tlte etymological signification of the terme
primary and secondcry intention. ln Etymology, tha
primary sense is that which was prior in point ol
time, or which most nearly approaehes to the mean-
ing of the root whence a word is derived: and every
variation from that sense is a secondary meaning. .

But in Logie, the vagus colloquial signification is
called primary: the striet philosophical appropri-
ation of the word is called the recondary intention.
