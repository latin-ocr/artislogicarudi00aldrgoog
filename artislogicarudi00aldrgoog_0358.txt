Again; An equulitp of property among ott the

an inequality os property.

2. But the more frequent mode of employing the
argument by contradiction is in the way of hypo.
thesis. Let the question, for example, be. Thereis
no natural vacuum pervadinp any port of the sotor
system. To prove this, it may be supposed, as a
kind of orpumentum od hominem or concession to the
objector, that there is a ramnum: If so, it must

our euperience convinces us that this is nott ecase:

Thus iu the second example in the text3 the .
meatem is, If twa numbers are prime to earhetha,
the differente between them is prime to the less picen
number. The argument does nat attempt to prave
this by its contradictory, but by showing that its
contradictory involves an impossibilitp. tf, the dis·
putant proceeds, the differenoe and the less number
be not admitted to be prime ta each other, suppose them

common measure above unity of both these numbers.
But it is already known that a common measure of
