The (lenos, which expresses the common or ma-
terial pert ol the essence.

The Difference, which expresses the distinguish-
ing or formal part of the essence.

The Property, which expresses that which is ·

¹ necessarily joined to the essenos.

The decident, which expresses that which is con-
tingently joined to the essence.
