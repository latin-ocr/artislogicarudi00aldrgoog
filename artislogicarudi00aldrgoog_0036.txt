in the grammatical sense, in contradistinction to the
subsequent expression voces oblique. The ancient
grammariane represented the natural form of a noun
as being creet or npriphtr and the varicus modifica-
tione which tbe noun undergoes in government, as
fallinps-off, (casua) or declensions lrom that erect
form. Hence vox recta, or (by estrange confusion
ol metaphor) casus rectas, was adopted to denote
the primitive form or nominative cose: while the
epithet obliquus was attached to the governed casee3
