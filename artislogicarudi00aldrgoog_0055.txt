42 DE PRAEDIOABILIBUS

aad individuale which are, or cau be 'supposed
to he.

A few other instance: may be added in illus·
tration oi this operation oi the mind. By abstract-
ing iram the individuale, Socrates, Plato, Xenophon,
Aristotle, &a the various circumstances in which
they differ from each ather; and riewing in coru·
binatiou all or the chief qualities or attributes

The imperfect exercise oi this faculty oi abstrac-

instance of it was ufforded by two natives of New
Zealand, who lately visited England. lieving in
their own country no quadrupede except dags, pige,
