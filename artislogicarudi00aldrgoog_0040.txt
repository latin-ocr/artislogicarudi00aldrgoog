tion or their formation, as, wickcd, anlolgq een-

3. Unioocum, est cujus una significatio aeque
convenit multis, ut loom: AEquioooum‚ cujus

diversae, ut Gallus: Analogum, cujus una in-
aequaliter, ut pes.

Two essential characteristics are to be noticed in
each oi these definitions3 namely, the number ofilio
significatione, aod lle applicatione of those significo·
lione lo tle things signified.

· 1. An Uniooool word has one signification only:
and in that one signification it is equally applied
to many things.

2. An Equioocal word has more ilion one significa-
tion: and in each ol its significatione it is a distinct
common term, and therefore applicable to many
objeots. The coincidence in sound‚ or sense, or both,
is merely occidental ; and is a great imperfectiori in
language. lt is probable that no language is exempt
from this evil: but it abonnds to a great extent
in the English. This is indeed a natural con-
sequence of the variety of sources from which
our words are derived. For a difference ol origin is
the chief occasion oi equivocal words. The following
are examples:

οἷςος· favourable wind: guard3 buffalo; bound-
ary: mountain. οὔςδς· trench3 whey.

'1⁰¹5‘ a dart3 poison. Βίος· life; olle a bow.

’'Alopae· (from dodonae) vagrant: (from linio)

Molullurlmasc.) mast oi a ship: (lem.) an opple

Τεηιρῑῖιθςθς time; temple oi tho head.
