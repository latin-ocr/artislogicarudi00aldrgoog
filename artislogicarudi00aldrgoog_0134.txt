OPPOSITIONE. lat

But is an universal io false‚'or a particular true,
the proposition subalternately opposed to it may bc
either truc or false. For instance: the universal
propositione. All historice are written on philosophicnl
principles, No nzinstrels were municione, are false:
but the subalternate of the latter is also ialee3 while
the subalternatc of the former is true. Again: it is
true both that some herbe ore poisoaous, and that
some mountaine ore elevated: bnt the universal
which comprehende the former is false3 that which
containe the latter is true.
