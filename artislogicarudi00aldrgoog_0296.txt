least evidentis the Ἀπιγυγὲ, that is, indirect prooi,
or argument ab impossibile so called because it
evinces that the thirty is, by displaying some mani·
fest contradiction, absurdity, or impossibility as
necessarily accompanying the supposition that tite
thirty is not. This method should never be employed,
except when no direct mode of proni is practicable.
Several of the propertius ol circles are thus demon·
strated by Euclid; see book iii. prop. l, 2, 4, 5, 6,
9, 10,11,12, 13, 16, 18, 23, 27; and the lastpro·
positione comprehended in prop. 7 aud 8. Such
arguments are indeed incontrovertible3 but the sub·
jective evidence produced by them is not so great
as that which proceeds from direct demonstration,
and consequently they do not effect the mind with
equal satisfaction.

2. Demonstratien of tlte fact (in) when direct,
may be either o priori, or a posteriori. The latter,
however, ought not to be introduced under the
head ο1 demonstration, in the sense in which the
word is here used, namely, as consisting in a de·
duction ο1 truths from premises either axiomatic or
demonstrated. lt is most adapted to physical or
moral prooi; thus, when a phenomenon or a fact
is admitted or proved by sufficient testimony, the
cause, or necessary antecedent to that fact or phe-
nornenon, is manifestly inferred: as, the sight oi
an eclipse affords prooi ο1 the relative position oi the
earth, the sun, and the moon.

3. Demonstration o priori is twofold: it infers
the conclusion either by means oi some remote
ceure,· aod then it is considered as proving no more
than the fact, and thus belongs to the former ge-
neral class of demonstration, namely, the in: or
by means ot' the immediate cause,· and thenit is
considered as more evident, and as constituting
the second class ο1 demonstration; namely, the irin.
11 this immediate cause he an axiomatio principle,
