DISJUNOTIVIS. 267

lt is easy to reduce these to conditional syllogisms‚
by alteriug the iorm oi the hypotheticel premier.
According to the directione in the text, the dis·
junctire proposition in the first ot the above iorrns
may he thus expressed conditiouelly: Is caloric is
o substance, it is not a quality.

lu the second form: If caloric is a quality, it
s's not a substance.

ln the third form: If culoric is not a substance,
u 21anqu hhhryth form : Is caloris is not a quality, it
isa substance.

By this change constructive conditional sylloqisms
are produced. And if the conditional promises
above approprieted to the first two forme, or those
appropriated to the third end fourth sorrns, he
respectively transposed, the conditional syllogismis
will be oi the destructive hind.

But there is very little utility in this process.
lt is more usefnl to observe thet disjunctive syl-
loqisms ere reduced to categorical syllogismo, hy

removing the disjunctive premier end completing the '

remaining enthymem: es,

1. No substance is a quality,- heat is a substance:
therefore s't is not a quality.

2. No substance is a quality: heat isa quality:
therefore hear is not a substance.

3. Every thinq immaterial (every not-substance)
inquality:¹ heat is immateriol‚· therefore heot isa
uality.
q 4. Whatever is not a quality is a substance: hrot
is not a quality: therefore heot is a substance.

Disjunctive syllogisms generally hare the cere·
goricel promise confirmed by a prosyllogism: es,

Virtues ore either saevities, passione, or habits:
But they are not sacultles or passione: (for brutos,
which cannot be virtuose, possess both ε) Theresore
they are habits. ·
