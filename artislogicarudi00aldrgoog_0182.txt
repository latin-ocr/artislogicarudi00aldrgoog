GENERALES. 169

particular ceses. For they simply amount to this,
that when those circumstances occur which are pro-
hibited by the rules, there is no comparison of two
objeote with a third term, with which both agree,
or with which one agrees end the other disagrees.
Consequently‚ the arguments in support of these
rules consist solely iu ou eppeel to those canons.

'ibe best means οι familiarizing the mind with
these rules is to epply them in the examinationi of
syllogisms. And lor this purpose it may be most
convenient to adopt the following method. Obtein
a definite apprehension ol the question, or proposi-
tion to be proved; and ol its component parts or
extremes. Then trane the middle term, or luinge
ou which the argument turns. Rejeot· needless
words, reduce synonymous expressions to the same
form, and supply whatever is elliptically left to the
judgment ol the render or hearer. Having thus
reduced the material argument into aformal syllo-
gism; first, observo whether the terms are correct
both asto number end senee; (rules l. and 3.)
aud whether the propositione are correct as to
number. (rule 9.) Theo, compare the syllogism
with the rules concerning particular aud negative
propositions3 (rules 5-8.) and lastly, examine the
distribution of the middle term, (rule 3.) aod ol the
extremes, (rule 4.)

For example, let the following material argument
be given:

Confidence in promiseris essentiol ιο tlte inter-
course of human life. Βιιι there could be no coo-
fidence iro promisee, if men were not obliged ιο
perform them. The obligatior therefore ιο per-
form promises is essential, ιο tle same ends, and
in tle same degree. (Paley.)

Here the question or problem is, Tre obligatior
