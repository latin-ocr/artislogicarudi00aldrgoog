metaphysical researches, audon subjects ol a moral
or political nature.

l. Moral Inductiorr, or observatius of the motives
aud effects of burnan conduct, tho influence of edu·
cation, association, and other circumstances, is the
foundation ol the moral and political axioms (with
the exception ol those exclusively derived from
divine authority) to which we habitually appeal lor
the regulation ol our conductio regard to ourselres
or society iu every new train of circumstances. The
man ol observation acquires from his historioal
knowledge, and from the facts which have succes·
sively presented themselves to his notice, when ju-
diciously examined and compared with each other,
aluud of axioms which he learns to apply syllogis-
tioally to any particulareme, in relation either to
the government ol n state, the direction and in-
struction of others, or the regulation of his own
conduct. Such a man is called prudent, and is said
to possess a knowledge ol human nature.

Moral proverbs are, or profess to be, the results
ol this kind ol induction. Tho Proverbs ol Solo-
mon, though they also rest ou the higher and iu-
dubitable foundation of inspiration, are general
axioms, the result ol the observations aud compa·
risons of the wisest of men.

Aristotle adopts the inductiva form, when he enu-
meratos all the virtues; (viz, fortitude, temporanee,
liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, lenity, friend-
liness, veracity, politeness, modesty, and justice;)
and after having shewn that each ol them consiste
in a medium, interstinctum rhus salt α’ςιτᾶς m-
rttt'rrmpttr alr, hcl written odrae ἵκοι rutilante. (Eth. Nic.
iv. 7.
