the quality of the predicate is vneres connected

Singular propositions cannot, iu strictness of
speech, be contradictori: lor their quantity cannot
be changed. But the contrary to a singular propo·
cition affords as perfect an oppositiou as the cou-
tradiction between universale aud particulare. ¹For,
the matter of a singular proposition cannot be con-
tingent3 aud in necessary aud impossible matter
contraries cannot he either both true or both false
together.

Thus in the following propositious, the o'ppotitiou
is iu sorm conwory, hut iu sense equivaleut to a cort·
trodiction.

Sobcootrory propositione cannot be both salse,-
uor can they be both trae except in contioycot
matter. The very delinitiou of contingent matter
requires that it should be cuch as to allow the pre·
dicate to bs at the same time asserted of coms
things comprised under the subject, aud denied of
others.
