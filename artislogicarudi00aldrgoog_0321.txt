308 FALLAGIAE

The Fallacies of this kind, being founded on mare
similarity of sound or of spelling, are for the most
part too trifliug to deservo notice. lustances in
abundence may be derived from the comedians of all
notione. Thus, the poet, ridiculing the imperfect
utterance of Alcibiades, says, '0 (biuga clv -ιιφαλὺν
zo'gcaoc ’ἔχιν . .. . ἐ’χιι (diga) chr cedatis κόλακος.
(Aristopb. Vesp. 45.) So the ponster pretends to
draw his inference concerning the cir, or the surr,
or a immolestum, from premises in which he had
previously employed the word heir, or son, or chesnut
horse.

3. Fallacia Figurae dictionis, quando propter
dictiones similes, quod de uno datur de altero
arripitur; e. g. Mercurius κοινὸς, ergo et
κοινωνικὸς.

This class of fallacies scarcely deserves to be dis·
tinguished from the preceding. The difference ie,
that the Fallacia prosodioe depends on the nse of
words which resemble each other in sound only; this
depends on words which resemble each other in their
real or pretended etymology.

Thus Lucretius found it convenient to represent
Animus and Anima to be so nearly allied, that what-
ever he supposes himself to have proved concerning
either of them may be inferred concerning the other.

Of this character is the absurd inference of the
sanctity of the meuse, (peda) under the supposition
that the term expressive of the most sacred rites
(porrigo) is deduced from it. Or that because
roal is an object of universal desire, so also is clus.
Or that because Philoxenus is well known as a
Victorem, no one can suspect him of not being a
man of Virtus. Such also is the frigid plea of Ajax,
that his name authorized him sal >a αἰάζων sal vglf.
