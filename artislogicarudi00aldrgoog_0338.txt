There is no consequence or mutual connexion
between the conclusion and the expressed premiss.
Yet to the proposes ol the argument there appears
to be a connexion, because he has assumed the false
principle that every cutbor will corfiue himself iu att
bis works to tlte some topics aad modes of expression.
Equally faulty are the following instaures:

' ‘⁶‘ Seven is a sacred number: the recurring period
ol especial devotion is the seventh day: the sacred
seuson of the Jewish J ubilee was the seventh year:
the seventh Jubilee was a periodos peculias privi-
lege: seveu leaves were miraculously distributed
among the multitudes3 and the same number is
marked with peculias distinction on many other
occasions. Who then can reasonably hesitate to
admit that there must be seven sacramenta in the
Christian Church? Or how can we listeu to those
who pretend that there are more than seven primary
planets belonging to our solat system ?”

“ Quoniam est animi natura reperta

Mobilis egregiet perquam constare necesse est

Corporibus parvis et laevibus atque rotundis.”

Luc. iii. 204.

‘¹ Forgers ol money audather disturbers of the
state are justly punished with death; therefore also
tretici, who are lorgers ol the saith, and, as expe-
rienca testifies‚ grievously disturb the state, ere
justly punished with death.”

Again: When the Atheniens iu their customary
strain ol vanity claimed confidence and respect on
the ground ol the exploits ol their ancestors, Archi·
damus urges that their argument uvas a follocu'o

cousequeutioe or a nou-sequitur. Καίτοι si πςὶς τοὺς
Melicos ἐγίνοντο dyuiol rius, orgis δ’ iuris muel νῦν,
διπλασίοις ζημίας ἄξιοί riuus, ‘iss ἄντ’ uiuariis uacui utpium·
