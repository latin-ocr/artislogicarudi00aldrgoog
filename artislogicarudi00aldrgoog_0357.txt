att DE DEMONSTRATIONE

irrationalis, tum St est homo, noa cst tono:
Et St Socrates cst memus, et scit sc osse mor-
tuam, tum Sr‘ est mortuus nort cst mortuus:
Et universaliter, Si et koec cst ocra ct quor icoc
notit.- tum Si ltaec oscos, rtorc est cerm qui·
bus omnibus inest una quse est prorsus nulla
difficultas. Ubi enim Hypotliesis evertit sup-
positionem, quidni ex Hypothesi sequatur,
quod suppositioni contradicit?

The methodos demonstrationi by means oi the
contradictory oi the question to be proved is
valid: and it frequently occurs that nc other method
can he conveniently adopted. The attempts, for
instance, ιο substitute direct arguments instead oi
the indirect proof giren by Euclid in proci of some ol
the mors simple properties of circles have'signally
failed.

The nature, however, ol this indirect proci is often
misunderstcod. lt requires a greater effert of mind
to apprehend the force of the reasoning. And many
are prejudiced against it by the enonaous imagina-
ticn, that it involves tlte absurdity oi proring a pro-
position to be true by admitting its contradictory
ιο be true. Whereas it merely, as a temporary
concessise, supposes the contradictory teba true,
for the purpose of tracing out the consequences ol
such a supposition.

l. One mode of emplcying tha contradictory in
support oi any theorem is simply ιο shew, that,
supposirtp tlte contradictory coer itud icen cr could
lte true, ιἰ, could not permanentior continue ιο. ot
this kind is tlte first example in the text.

In like manner it may be argued, that rtem
cannot bc c vacuum: foris ttae coer tau berno
