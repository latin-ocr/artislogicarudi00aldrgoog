INDUOTIO. 2³1

powers and operatione of the mind, the student
has, primarily, but one subject on which he is able
to make his observations; namely‚ his own mind.
By habitual· reflecticn, however, he may watch and
scrutinize its operatione under the influence oi a
variety of different circumstances. And he may
infer, with a high degree of probability, that the
process which he discovers to take place in his own
mind, bears a great similarity to that which meurs
in the minds oi men in general. Yet lre is con-
tinually liable tc be misled in consequence of an
inability to distinguish between those operatione
which are purely natural and common to all who
are possessed of mind, and those which are adven·
titicus, the result of early habits and associatione
formed long before he had entered on his philoso-
phical speculations.

Next to his own experience, the metaphysicien is
suabled to improve his acquaintance with the human
mind by tvacing its operatione in those about him.
Here he has a wide scope. He learns something
from the old and young, the vich and poor, the
learned and unleavned‚ the poet and the philoso-
pher. Yet here also'he lies under a great disad-
vantage; he can only conjecture what pasees in the
mind oi others, by the means oi the expressions,
the conduct, the countenance, and other external
circumstances, which are but imperfect and osten
inaccurate indices oi the real operations oi the
mind.

The recorded sentiments oi other metaphysicel
studente afford a third, bnt perhaps the most ex·
ceptionable help to this speeies oi induction. These
should be received with suspicion; lor every writer
of talent is able so to trace cut bis opinions on this
subject, that the mind oi the student is involuntarily
borne clong3 and is made to ieel as it its own pre·
vicus and natural mode of operation were described
