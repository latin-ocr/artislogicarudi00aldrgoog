DlvlSIONIBUS. 25

annm, cui praefigiture ut, nvn Ῐιονηο, i. e. omnia
praeter hominem: unde particula nvn, dicitur'
irfiniluns.

The proper English terrns which express this di-
risinn of nouus are Definite, and indefinite.

By prefixing the negative particle the expression
is rendered (not infinite, but) indefinite. lf it be
predicated of any thing that it is not a book ,· that
one thing, book, alone is excluded‚ while it con-
tinues wholly andesined what other thing the sub·
ject thus spoken ul may be.

A definite noun and its corresponding indefinite
noun together constitute a perfect division or dicho-
tomy. Thus, all animale are either rational vr not-
rativncl; all created things are either sentient or nvn·
sentient: corporenl vr incorporeal,· alimen are either
virtnons or noi-virtvvus.

2. Ponticum, est quod significat rem quasi

praesentem: Privclivutn‚ quod dicit absentiam
rei a subjecto capaci: Negotium, quod ab in-
capaci. Sic nomo est vox positiva3 videns dici-
tur dehomine positive‚· creans de homine pri-

vative,· caecnn, seu potius non videns, de lapide
negative.

ln the sentence, Tbe satellites of Jupiter are visi-
ble tbroupb a telcscopc, both the word visiblia, and
tha other terras employed, are used positively. ln
the sentence, T be moon is occasionally invisible, the
word invisible is used privativae, and the predicate,
an invisible titinp, is apricative novn; because it ex.
presses the absence of visibility from tle moon which
is capable of beinp scen. But when itis said, Tire
numan saul is invisible, the word invisible is nepetiva
