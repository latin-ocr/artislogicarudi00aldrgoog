DE METHODO. tue

to himself en attilicial notion of the qualities which
any number of them possess in common3 proceeds
further to decompose tbat idea, and so on succes-
sively until be bas reached that which he deems the
most simple apprehension. That is, he proceeds
from tbe individuals to the lowest species; from

thieto the proximate genus, and so on through the
subalternate genera until he arrives et the highest
or mort abstract genus3 each process ol tbe ana-
lysis bringing him to a less complex or more simple
notion.

Thus the lew of optics, that the atqle os reflection
is equal to tlte ample of inciderem, is derived from the
observation ol many facts, each ο1 them compre·
hending many other circumstances3 for instance,
that the light proceeded from the sun or a lamp;
that the incident ray proceeded from a tower or a
post; that the reflecting substance was a river or a
mirror3 that tbe refraeted ray was ascertained by its
meeting a human eye, or by its illuminating an
opaque substance. But the philosopher by anolysis
separates all these constituent parts ο1 the facts
under examination, and fixas bis attention on that
one particular, the equality ο1 tbe angle ol incidence
und reflection3 from which he deduces the general
lew above stated.

Again, the practieal geologist discovers the
various strata of the earth under a great variety of
circumstances, as to thickness, extent, nearness to
the surface, obliquity‚ dre. But by pursuing tbe
analytical method he deduces general lews as to the
order and succession of the several strata; and from
the pbenonrena which attend them, considered as
effecte, he acquires a probable conjecture ol their
origin and tbe causes ο1 their relative position and
qualities.

Thus moreover, it we would analytically acquire
au acquaintance with the sciense of minerelogy‚ we
may enter on a personal examination ol all the
