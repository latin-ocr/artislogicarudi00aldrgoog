Mathematieorum methodum in ooeteris arti-

bus et scientiis, si tenere non liceat, aemulari

certe licet. Quo ad hano quaeque proprius
accedit, eo caeteris perfectior, et ad docendum

aptior videtur. Sed ad eaquae docentur reti-
nenda, nihil est utilius absoluti operis con-
spectu; in quo, eaquae sunt ante (extra or-
dinem fortasse) demonstrata, suis quaeque in
locis, h. e. servatii Logicorum methodo, repo-
nantur.

Mathematieians lay tha foundation oi their sub·
sequent demonstratione, first, in definitione, which,
while their primary object ie simply to fix the signifi-
cation of the tenne employed, serve at the same time
as artificia! principles3 and then, in certain natural
principles, of which some are practical, called pos-
tulatesr and others theoretical, which are called
namma

The order of propositione (aa for instance in
Euclid) ie partly natural, partly arbitrary. lt is
probabis that any one who should independently
discover the same truths, would arrange thern very
differently, and yet perhaps not less scientifically.

Asynoptic arrangement of mathematical conclu·
siens according to their subjecte and relations isa
profitahle exercise. The theorema of the first book
of Euclid, lor example, might he thus arranged:
