DE DILEMMATE. 261

enisis, it euists either antonp ciuiiized or amonp un-
ciuilized communities. But amonp the latter itis
not discoperahler fer att the actious of sauepes are
repulated oy that narrow sels-love which induces
each to pain his own ends by cruelty ond injustice.
Nor is there a much uearer approach to it omonp
ciuitized communitum sor the improvements of
ciuilization produce only a spurious kind of virtue,
which owus no better notice than mere eupedienep.
Therefore perfect virtue is a thinp which does not
esest.

When it was proposed to send an embassy to
Antony to induce him to saise the siege oi Modeun
and withdraw from Gaul, Cicero among other
arguments oppones the measure by this Dilemma.
Lepatos decernitis? si ut deprecentur, contemnet:
si ut imperetis, non audiet. (Philipp. v. 9.) This
argument may be thus analyzed:

If the proposed embassy has no prospect of sac-
cess either oy pour entreaties or by pour commuads,
it oupht not to be sent:

But the proposed embassy hos no prospect of
success whether it conveys your entreaties or your
commende: ,

(For pour eutreuties·will he received with cou-
tempt,· and pour commands witi be met hy refusal :)

Therefore the proposed embassp oupht not to he
sent.

The first of these sentences contains the Con-
ditiuual proposition with a distributive antecedent.
The second clause (in the constructive form) esta-
hlishcs each branch of that antecedent. The third or
parentheticul sentence contains two prosyllopisrns5
one in support oi each branchos the previous pro-
position. And the last clause presente the con-

, clusion ot' the hypothetical syllogism.

The whole may be categorically expressed thus:

That embmsy which whether it entreats or cour·
munds hus no prospect of succen should not he sente
