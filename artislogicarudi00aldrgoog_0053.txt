40 DE PRAEDICABILIBUS

straet notiou: from the latter it is called a penerel
or universal notiou.

This abstract or universal notiotr is expressed by a
sipn or word which is called common. And such a
word, notwithstanding the many individuale to
which it applies, is considered as a representative of
that one notiou, or orte object3 otherwise it would
cesse to be au univoca! term. For the notion isselt,
aud the supposed subject of it, are no longer thought
of as existing in a variety of things numerically
different3 but as being, to whatever individuale it is
applied, still one and the same. That the thing
supposed by that notiou, the airh ieamer, the uai-
versal nature, really existe, is not to be conceived.
No such thing as obstruet-man, (arisi litigem)
obstruet-animat, obstruet-colom, obstruet-hamorry,
independently of any particular modification and
combination, cau exist; we only imagine or conv
ceive them to exist for the convenience of generalise-
tion aud elassifieation.

The process of the mind iu abstractiou may be
thus more fully illustrated. Au infant first atteias
the individual notione of its father, ite mother, its
brother, its nurse, &a ln these it perceives, be-
sides the characteristic attributes oi each, certain
qualities possessed by all as a kind of common
nature. ln process of time it sees other objects,
in many respecte similar to these. lt lays aside
the ideas of relationship, sex, dress, height, rank,
&c which distinguish the individuale from each
other; aud having thus iramed to itself one idea,
which is equally applicable to each, learns to de-
note that idea by the name mort.

Again ; we observe horses, corus, lions, depe, apes,
&c (which are themselves also general or oom-
mon words expressing ideas attaiued by abstrac-
tion lrorn the individuale os each kind respec-
lively 3) and we discover iu theru several qualities
