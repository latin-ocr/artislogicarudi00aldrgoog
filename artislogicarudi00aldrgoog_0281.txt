‘268 DE SYLLOGISMIS DISJUNCTIVIS.

The seme argument may be expressed condition-
olly, by substituting for the disjunctive premiss
either of the following: ff virtues are not faculties
or passione, tfrey are latin,- 0r‚ If virtues ore not
habits, they vvest be eitliersocvlties or passions. .

lt may also be expressed cateoorically by sub-
stituting the following in the place of the hypo-
thetical premiss: Tloose qualities of tle sonl which
are neitlersccnlties nor passione ninst de habits.

All re9al yovernments must be either hereditcry or
elective: ond cs Ι believe there is no instance wlfereio
tlre croton of Enyland los ever been asserted to be
elective, except by tte re9icides at tle infament end
enparolleled trial of Kinq ceorles tte F irst‚ it must
of consequence be hereditary. (Blackst. Comm. v. l.
b. i. ch. 3.)

Here the introductory proposition is the major
r premiss of a categorical syllogism in Barbara, of
which the disjunctive member constitutos the major
extreme; namely‚ All recol yovernments are either-
lrereditary-or-elective5 tlre Evylislv qovernment is e
reyal eovernmentr therefore tlre Enqlislr covernment
is eitlver hereditcry or elective. On this conclusion
is founded a disjunctive syllogism‚ the categorical
premiss of which is supported by a prosyllogism3
namely, Tne Enytisli qovernment is eitter hereditcry
or elective; bittit is not elective, (for universal testi
mony otro α sin9le exception declares it to be not
elective) tlreresore it is hereditcry.
