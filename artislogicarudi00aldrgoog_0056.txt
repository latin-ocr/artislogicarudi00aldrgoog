FORMANDIS. 43

comprehend those three classes of animale: they
applied their name for dog (cnrdddee) at first to
those two species which were new to tbem; and
subsequently to every quadruped which they saw in
England‚ as supposing them to he no more than par·
ticular variations ol the same species. Upon fur-
ther acquaintance, however, with tha various kinds
ol animals, they adopted coruddee in a sense equiva-
lent to quadruped‚ expressing the several species by
adding ιο ιΙιιιι word the English name of the animal.
Thus they carried back with them to their own
country the names, carnddec-ltorsa caraddee-cow,
adreddere-sheep, as well as caraddee-dop: employ.

(that is, comprehending iewer simple ideas, and
extending ιο a greater number of individuals‚) than
that which they had originally attached to it.

A similar process is observable in other lan·
guages. Thus tha Greeks and the Romans, as they
emerged from the state of barbarity‚ transferred the
words decri end virtus, from their original applica-
tion, (as denoting the only umral excellence which
they acknowledged, namely, manlinese or couroye)
to a more abstract sense, including every morai ee·-
cellence: that is, to speak technically, the word at
first indicative ol the species became appropriated to
the penne. So lineamina, originally applied to distri-
butive justice, subsequently acquired a more abstract
application ιο universal οἱιιιιοι quodlicet, which pro-
bably was first employed to denote benevolence, has
gradually acquired its present more extended sense.

There are many words in the use oi which we
may trace au opposite process, the more abstract
aud extensive term having subsequently acquired a
less abstract signification, by the addition oi soma
new ideas to those which it originally compre·
hended. We have exemplos oi this in the words,
passion, when applied to anyer ,· οΙιιιιίιῃι applied to
