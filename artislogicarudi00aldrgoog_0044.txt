Itis not accurate to assent that equivocnl words
have their significatione equally agreeing with the
several objecta to which they are applied. On the
contrary, they are liable to be employed in every
variety ol awalopy which each ol their several signifi-
catione may admit. The same words are therefore

ther tbe different significatione ol κόσμος and mundus
were attached to those worda by a merely accidental
coincidence, or whether they originatod in any
supposed analogy. On the other band, some words
which are really equirooal have an apparent approxi-
mation in sense which occasions them tu be mistaken
lor analogous words: as, tole, derived from two
distinct Saron words, from one ol which it receives
