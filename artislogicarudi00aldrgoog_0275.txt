262 DE DILEMMATE.

Bet rte ¹proposed embooty to Amooy ltus rto pro· ⁵

spect ‹rssrrooess whether s't entreats or commanos,-
therefore the proposed eoobossy to Antooy should
mhhhshhine implies that tho membsrs oi the dis-

junctive consequent should be only two. lt is ,
however applied without limitation to any number Ϊ

of alternativos.

These observations, together with tho rules laid

down ior hypothetioal arguments in general, will =

sufficiently illustrate tho form of the dilemma.

The rules which relate to the matter ol tho dilom- ¹

ma are chiefly tho three following.

l. A dilemma must be so framed that ome altor-
native most be admitted. This ir its first tunda-
mental rule. Its entire force is lost unless the onu-
meration of alternatives be exhaustive, so as to form
aoompleto logical division. Hence the use oi the

definito word with its correlative indefinite is pecu· <¹

liarly appropriato to tho dilemma. Tho charge,
Esther tte restored the money entrnsted to him or he is
a thies, would not be a cogent dilemma; for it might
be answered, lte retained tlte money at the reqnett os

theutonem orimoooseqrtenoeostrr'oobseaoe. Thus ’

it is insufficient to say, All compastores ore either
profitable or perniciem. lt is also inaccurate to
raason thus ; If yon ohooqe your course ‘ff life, you
must either be irfirrenoed hy your oreo jndqmertt,
sotim is in sarah enses peoniiarly liutto to be biosred
hypossioo or pro'udtoe: or yon mest te bliodly led
byrome iwdoffereot or interested person, sotto warato
his oron advantage while prorsessr‘oy to sot ymera, or
roho to sone himself the trouble of thmkiny yioee Itis
advice at romdom. In both these instantes n third
alternative may be adduoed. Companloos may be

simply root injuriosa thonqh not profitable. A ᾗ
