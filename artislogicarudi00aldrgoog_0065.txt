ledge of their nature will indeed suffice to enable ns
to refer the specics to its proximate penno. But it
is difficult to decide which, among the various attri-
butes and characteristics of any particular class of
beings or of notions, is really the chief attribute,
and tho occasion of the inferior attributes : that is,
which of theru constitutos the difference and which
the property. We readily refer gold, siloer, διο.
to the genus nsclolr horre, con, &cto theganus
animab solip, mse, &c to the genus floner. But
it is impossible, in the present state of our know-
ledge, to decide which is that quality which essen-
tiolly distinguishes each of those species from the
other species comprised under the same genera.
Naturalists are therefore compelled either to enu-
merate all the distinguishing qualities which thoy
can discover in each3 or to adopt an arbitrary mark
of distinction instead of the essential differeoco.
