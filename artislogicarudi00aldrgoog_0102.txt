'lo bc true or lalss is the property ofjodyment;

to sipnify what is true or false is therefore the pro·

perly used, when applied to any operation oi the
mind not comprehended under judgrnent.

3. An ambiynoos sentence is in iacta double eeu·
tence. Ambiguity may be occasioned either by the
equivocal sense of the words, or by the dubious
construction ol the sentence.

The heatben eracles afford numerous instances oi
both these kinds oi ambiguity; as,

Kgolm ’Ἀλω lrossoie μεγάλην ἰςχὲν monins· which
leit it doubtful whether the kingdom oi Persia or oi
Lydia was to be destroyed. (Herod. i. 74.)

’Ἥξει hugnanis πᾶλιμκ ul λοιμὸς llp’ ιῦτᾷ· where the
ambiguity consiste in the similarity of sound be-
tween triple aod napis. (Thoe. ii. 54.)

†tl⁸'l'i [laminir oleph leoni. (Time. il. 17.)
,fundationem exquirite matrem. (AEn. iii. 96.)

Comic writers abound with ambiguous sentences,
intended to be strictly more than one sentence, that
is, to be understood in different sensos; as,

Ὠ phar, λίιι πιδᾷς· Yon are oery diligently meao-
i⁵a5g ; or, you arc living very estrooogontly. (Ar. Nobi

Ilanli igit l see (roi onnia) a calm,- or (γαλῆν) α
weooel or cat. (Eur. Or. 279. Aristoph. Rara. 306.)

Thus Cicero represents the Siciliane ns σιγῆς,-
Non mirandum est jus tom aequom esee Verrinam:
describing the mode of ndnrinisterinp justice proctiserl
by Verres io words which also signify honr-broth.
(Verr. i. 46.)

Many passages in ancient authors appear ambi-
guous because we are not sufficiently acquainted

with tlre idiom oi their lapgnage or with allusione
