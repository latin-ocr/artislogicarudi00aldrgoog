PROPOSITIONUM. 127

Universol nepesine propositions are convertible nor
only simply, but also accidentally. For since the
simple converse is true, the particular which is sub·
alternate to that simple converse is also true; which
(by the definition) is the occidental converse ol the
primary proposition. Thus, if it is true that, No
loris are wsb-footed birds, it follows by simple con-

versios that, No weh-footed birds ore iaris: whence
it is necessarily true by the laws ol opposition‚ that,
Some wsb-footed birds a're noi lorks; which is the
converse per occidens of the original proposition.

Universa! affirmative propositione may be con·
verted peraccidens. For when A is true, its sub-
alteru is also true3 which subaltern, being l, is
simply convertible; and irs simple converse will be
the occidental converse oi A. Thus it is westher,
Ricimere arc universollp exposed lo many snares; it
is therefore true that, Some rich men are exposed to
many snares; of which the converse is also true,
Some miro are exposed io many snarer cre rich men.
But this is the accidental converse of the original
proposition.

The same may be illustrated by the following ex-
amples:

Everp acl of fortitude is an aci ofnirtue:

Some ncls os virne ore acis offortitudc.

Au the carnus rooles in society tend to ilie common
gogdojne things which tend io lire common good arc the
variwcr ranis in society.

All tigeri cre carnivorons:
Smne carnivorous animale arc ligere.

An universal affirmative proposition may be simply
converted when its predicate is distributed: as,
‘H riiarpcow'ae icrl ri ἔραται· Ἠ sigeri irrrr sillani periens·
'O μιγαλόψνχὲς irrw i μεγάλαν airh alerii, ἄξας iii. Fr
