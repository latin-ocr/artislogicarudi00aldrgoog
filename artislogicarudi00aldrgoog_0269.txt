quicunqne sit, ob eam ipsam cansam qnod is horno sit,

consultam uelit, necesse est secundnm eandem naturam
omnium utilitatem esse communem„ Quod si ita est,

The mathematical argument ad impossibile is a
destructive hypothetical syllogism, usually founded
on a premiss dedused from a conditional Sorites.
For instance:

I f a straight line drawn at right angles to the di·
ameter os a circle at its entremity dces nat sall raith·
out the circle, it falls within it,· if it salls roilhin it,
it may be produced till it meets the circumferences is
so, a straight lincfrom the contre to the point of meet-
ing is eqnal to the semidiarneter between the centra and
the extremity from schiah the line mas drann at right
angles ; is so, the imo linesfrom the centro, raith the
line at the extremity of the diameter, form an isosceles
triangle,· if they sarm an isosceles triangle, the angles

subtended tp the eqnal sides are eqnnl: is equal, they '

are both right angles.- if this be the case, tna angles
of a triangle are eqnal to troo right angles: There·
sternis a straight line drama at right angles to the
diameter ql a circle at its eatremitp does not fall raith-
ont the circle, it occasions the existence of a triangle
containing troo angles eqnal to troo right an lest bnt
nothing can occasion this ; therefore sach a line must

fall nithart the circle. (Ena. El. iii. 16.)

Evesy correct conditional syllogism may be rs·
