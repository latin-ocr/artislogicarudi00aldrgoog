the probable destruction ol the invaders of Sicily
(Τ huc vi. 83 Ὀλίγιι γὰρ... ,instituted

Demosthenes thus introduces an apposite Ex-
ample. iulg ἧς (ndens) ις μὲν τοὺς ἰπιόιτιις ἔιιιίιιιι
adscensumue, 2ol dr Μιιςιιθῖιῑι rur necyn ιιι adrui μιίλι voror alr
ιι ιιιι ιιιι troppo

A corddct and lordible instance ol this mode of
argument by analogy occurs in l Samuel xvii.
34-47. The examples also used by the Israelites
in their lively remonstrance with the Renbenites,
&c (losh. xxii. 17, 18, 20.) by the Jewish elders
iu behali σι’ Jeremiah, (Jer. xxvi. 17-19) and by
Gamaliel tn behulf ol the apostles, (Acts v 36-39. )
ure very apposite und striking. The speech of
Rabshakeh, recorded m lseiah xxxvi 18‚19,20.
presente a fallacious instance of the same. The
conclusion ιιι this cese is not drawn de simili.- there
was no just comparison between the omnipotent God
oi lsrael aud the idol-gods os the heathen.

This species ol argument, even when derived
frum real facts, produces only a low degree ot moral
probability. But it comprehends also similes and
even sables, which, although really uo more than
illustratione, affect the unguarded mind as if they
were arguments, and are therefore frequently sub-
stituted for proof by Rhetoricians. Thus the latter
pert of the first illustration irorn Livy (Quemadmo-
dum pedites dc.) is en Enample,· though of on
inferior order to those contained iu the preceding
portion ol that sentence. Thus Demosthenes:

'O μιίγι γι(βιιιιλιιιι) monlon& ὤιςφιι ι·,ιι ὶίγιι· τοῦτο dt ιιι ¹

duda, {ortissu ιιιιὶ yn< ryis agninae, nal ιιὶ φςιιιιιιιπιλιπιιι
dovre ιι,ιι ἔιὶι τις ιιιι’ ιιιιιιιι edfleda ιιιιὶ ιιιλλιὶ λιιμβιί vy.

Agaiu, He who voluntarily continues in ignorantes,
is guilty of alt the crimes which opnoronce predonem
us to him who should entinpnislr tlte tapers of u lipht-
house may justly be imputed the calamities os ship-
wreck. (Dr. Johnson.)
