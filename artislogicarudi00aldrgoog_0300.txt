themselves are also used by some writers iu so

Nor is it necessary that every treatise should

system. On the contrary, it is often convenient
to adopt the opposite methods in different parts

of a treatise on the same science or branch of
scrence.

The analytic method therefore commences with
complex substances or notione, and reduces them·
first to more simple, aud then, if possible, to the

Since therefore all the objects which first present
themselves tc our senses, and all the notione which
