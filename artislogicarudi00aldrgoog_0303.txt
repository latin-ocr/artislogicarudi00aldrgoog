earths, and stones, and metele, &c which we cen
discover3 scrutinizing distinctly their varicus prc-
perties and characteristics; classilying them by
ydacing together those in which there existe a
striking similarity3 reviewing the classes, and re-
arranging them according to more comprehensive
similaritiee; and so on repeatedly‚ until we arrire
at certain classes of the most general nature, with
the laws of their locality, formation, combinatione,
gravity, fusibility, crystallizaticn, &n

2. The syntdctc‘c mellend is the reverse ci the
analytic. lt commences with that which is most
simple, and following the process of nature, consiste
in combination. lt lays down simple trnthe cr
general axiomatic principles, end proceeds from
them to derivative and complex truths. lt begins
with such mental objects as are most abstracted;
and traces them successively in chararicus aggre-
gatee of which they form part.

Thus, to recur tc the examples above girenz a
trectise on caloric may begin with stating its simple
nature ae a south fluid substance partemne gf cuch

ond such qualiticsr or, ar c oibrctory affection os

the particlee of matter distinguished by etech ond
such elloronensium (according to the theory which
the author judges most probable;) and then proceed
tc shew the subjecte in which caloric is discoverable,
its symptomS, effecte, dec.

Again,a system oi chemistry may he introduced
by the description of the pure gaees and other

elementary substances, and thence proceed to the ³

various combinatione found in nature.

The metaphysicien may, in like manner, begin
with the definition of Baetem and then, adding to
that simple idea the notione oi dependence or inde-

pendence, explain the complex notione of menoare r

end quality, and so on, until he arrives at the ag-
gregate of ideas comprehended in the lowest speciae,
