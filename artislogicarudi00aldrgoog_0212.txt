VALlDlTATE. 190

A ain;
gberlin Worldly bonoim are transient vanities ,-
An Transient vanities are sources pf certain
disappointment: Tisenffore
tlp Some sources vs certain disappointment are
norldlp honours.

The transposition oi the promises produces the
following new antecedent, in Barbara:

All transient vanities are sources of certain disap-
pointment: Worldly lionam are transient vanities.
The conclusion from which premises is; Worldly
honours are sources os certain disappointment: of
which the original conclusion is the converse per
accidens: aud is therefore implied iu it.

Another method ot‘ ostensive seduction, namely‚ by
negative or contrapository conversion, is applicabis to
the two modes Barake aad Bokardo. lt is accom-
plished by substitutiug for the major premiss its
nepotive converse,· to which, in Bokardo‚ must be
added the transposition of the promises. This pro-
cess may be symbolized by the names Fetere, iu·
stead ot‘ Barolr03 and Datames, instead ot‘ Bokardo.

Let the following he a sylloglsm in Baroko: (that
is, Fakoros) ¹

Propitoble property will produce an income more
etan sufficient to replnce tie expensos attendunt on
it ; But some conl-mines will not prosince susle an
income: Tierefore some caol-mines arc not propitable

r erty.
p σέ] couverting the major premiss by contrapositam
the minor premiss is rendered affirmative, (the ne-
gative particle being combined with the predicate)
aad the new syllogismis in Ferio. Thus: Wtat-
soever will not produce an income more titan suf·
ficiens to replaae tie expensos attendant on it is not
profitable propertys But some caol-mines utili not
produce sucis an income: Theresae some caui-mines

ore not propitable property.
