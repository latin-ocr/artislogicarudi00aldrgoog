Sorae morderem ore aot traitort: therefore,
Some morderem do aot destrae capital punishment).

The process of the major extreme is here illicit.
ln its premiss, it is the predicate of an affirmative,
and therefore t's not distributed; in the conclusion,
being the predicate of a negative, it ir distributed.
No inference can be deduced from these premises.

is inaccurate: the premiss speaks of some thiaps

The inversion of the order of the promises (the
minor premiss being first) is a deviation from the
form, but does not render the argument incorrect.
The promises will admit of the particular conclu-
sion, Some os aar emises may be dcceioed.

This illicit process from an undistributed to a
distributed extreme is a violation of the first rule;
ior the pretended syllogism contains four termS.
lt is therefore inconsistent with the fundamental
principle of syllogistic argument; for the term
compared with the middle term is not the identical
term of the question. Thus in the examples above
giren, All preat talkerr, all who deseror capital
punishment, dre. are the terms of the quostiam but
