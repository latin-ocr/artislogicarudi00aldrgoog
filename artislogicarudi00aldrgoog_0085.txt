ta DE DIVISIONE.

tions of the other membersof the division, as dimano,
quadrumana, &a (see peges 60, 61.) It may in
general be obserred, that those denominations of
genera which are derived from the leading specics
contained under them, (as catacea, selca) are less
satisfactory and scientific than tbe adoption of signi·
licant names. The botanical arrangement of Jussieu
is faulty in this respect.

But the former of these two rules is of still
greater importance. A genus should be distributed
into the species immediately subordinate tc it.
These may, if necessary, be divided hya subsequent
process into their respective subspecies. Thus, tbe
division of knowledpe into sensible, rational, and
,artificial knowledge is harsh aad unsuitable. lt
should be first divided into natural and artificial;
and the former brench may theu be subdivided into
sensible and rational. Again, European Architec-
ture would be clumsily divided into Grecian, Gom·
posite, Normon, and Enplislr. lt should he rather
divided into Grecian and Enplisltr tbe former class
into pure (comprehending tbe four orders) and
mixed or compariter the latter class (Enplislt) into

’ Nornran and pure-Enplt'slr3 this being also sub-

divided into early, decorated, aud perpendicular

dicero thus complains of the violation of this rulo:
¹‘ Quomodo autem philosophus (Epicurus) loquitur
tria genera cupiditatum? naturales et necessarias:
naturales, non necessarios.- nea naturales, nec neces-
sarios? Primam divisit inelegantem duoanim genera
quae erant, fecit tria. Hoc non est dividere sed
frangere rem. Qui si diceret, cupiditatum esse duo
genera, naturales et inanes: naturalium quoque item
duc, necessarias et non necessariasr confecta res
esset. Vitiosum est enirn in dividendo, partem ia
genere numerare.”

But Cicero himself alsa errs “ partem in genere
numerando.” lle represents Panaetius to have been
