the dyllogistic system. Such an objection is how·
arar as unrensonable as it would be to urge that
grammar is futile, from the harshness which the
writings oi any author would present ii all the
grammaticel ellipses were supplied. Theman who
should publish the Spectator with every gramma-
ticnl ellipsis filled up, end he who should reduce
Euclid’s Elements to formal syllogisms, would alike
display their own absurdity, but would not prove
any lutility, either in the science oi grammar, or
in tha principles or practice oi syllogistic argu-
ment.

lt is not the province oi Logic to ascertnin the
truth oi the propositione in an argument. which
, must be tbe appropriate office oi other sciences;
but, supposing the principles true, to ascertain the
inierences deducible from them. lt effecte this
chiefly by guarding the mind against the fallacias
which may arise from the language in which an
argument is expressed. ‘l'o this object the follow-
