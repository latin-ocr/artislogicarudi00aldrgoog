242 SORITES.

and so on, till all the propositione of the Sorites are
exhausted. The first proposition becomes the minor
premissos the lest syllogism‚ the conclusion of which
is the general inference of the Sorites.

The inspired author of the Epistle to the Romans
mure than once employs this mode ol argument.
The Sorites in chap. viii. 29, 30, when reduced to
form, and expressed in the most concise manner,
will appear thus:

All thesorekncwn cre predestinated:

All tlie predestinated are called .·

All tlte called arejustified:

Att tlte justified are ylorifled:

Therefore, All tlte forelenown ore ylorified.

Aristotle argues thus: Ode uir, pul airus impie,
mireris ih· οὔτ’ ἄλλαγὲ, ἰσότητος pli cirne· οὔτ’ irim,
ptri oiim συμμετρίας. (Est. Nic. v. 5.) ‘l'hnt is;

voluation of property requires tlte adoption of α
common measure: Tlreresore stu preservation of
society requires tlte adoption os o common measure.

The first and second propositione ol this Sorites,
when transposed, afford premises in Barbara, which
prove the conclusion, Tne preservationi of society re·
, quires equitadle voluntion os property. And this con·
clusion‚ with the third proposition in the sorites,
constitutes another antecedent in Barbara, whence
is deduced tlte conclusion above drawn, hemely, The
preservation os society requires rte adoption of a corn-
rnon measure.

Sylloyismuseu propositionibus constat, propositiones

notiones ipsoe (id quod basis rei sunt) confuse sint et
temere a rebus abstracte, nihil iniis qne superstru-
untur est firmitudinis. (Bac. Ory. 14.) That is;
