19⁶ DE REDUCTIONIS

5. r. ne ltedwtronis varenae.

REDUCTIONIS ostensivae validitas sic os·
tenditur. Ex praemissis reducendi, per con.
versionem imperatam, necessario colliguntur
praemissoe reducti: atque ex iis, per figuram

primam, conclusio reducti: qure vel ipso con-
clusio reducendi erit, vel par lautianm waver-
eioncmfiet.

ln ostensive reducum, the significant consonante
attached to the vowels which symbolice the pre·
muas imply directions to make the requisito changes.
The new premises being thus obtained, the con·
clusion is to be deduced immediately from them.
The compariaon of this new conclusion with that
of the original syllogism affords the required evi·
dence of validity. When no significant consonant ia
eubjoined to the symbol ol the conclusion, (as in
Gesare, Pelopiae.) the two conclusione are the same.
But when s or p follow the final vowel, the new
conclusion will be found reducihle to the original
conclusion by simple or accidental conversion.

For example:
cEs Thcfined stars do not revolve about a centres
A The planeta revolve obnata centra: Theresore,
rE The gilonem cre notflred stare.

To illustrate the correctness of this method ol
reasoning, let the premises be so arranged, or
changed for others equivalant to them, as to reduce
them into the first figure. This will be effected by
the simple conversion of the major premite, es in-
timeted bythos annexed to its symbol. The new
