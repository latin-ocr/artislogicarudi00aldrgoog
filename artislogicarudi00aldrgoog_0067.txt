⁶4 DE SPECIEBUS
A Genus is (logicclly speaking) a suboles thet is,

the word which represents a genus is appliccble to a ·

whole cluss, the parts of which consist of the several
species which that genus comprises, or of which it
is predicated. Thus, Animal is the nome of a class,
comprehending the species mon and brute ,- of which
it may be said, All men ure animab.- ull brutes cre
animale. Rectilinecl fipure comprehende triaoples,
quadrilaterals, and polygonos the individuale under ’
cll these species being included in that genus.

A Species is (metaphysicelly speaking) a soboles
thet is, the abstract notion denominated a Species is
c complex or aggregate idea3 nnd is therefore rc·
solvible into its component parts. These parts ere
the simple or less complex notione of the Genus
end the Difference. Thus the idea of Mau is formed
by the combination of the ideas animal and rational.
Rhetorio includes the two notions of sciense as its
Genus, und employed in discoverinp what is persua-
sioe es its Difference. ·

A Species may be referred, in different points of
view, to different penem. Thus the Tiper may, by
distinct processes of abstraction, be considered as
belonging to the genus, Felisr or Quadrupedr or
Asiclic animal ,- or Ravenous beust, &css

Many species heve no appropriate name, but are
expressed by the combination of their constituent
parts, the Genus end Differmee: for instance3 pas-
sivequciity, rectilinea-figure, eigil-uu led-triungle
port-wine, greenfinci‚ ’ναίω-Μ. Otbers cre de-
noted by the Difference alone, as, a repectu, (wdtch
which strikes the bcur,) Madeirc, champagne.
