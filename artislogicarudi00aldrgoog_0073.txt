62 DE SPECIEBUS

Quare 1. Differentia est vel Genetica, quae
constituit Speciem Subalternam3 vel Specifica,

quae infimam: haec est quae de numero diffe- ,

rentibus, illa, quae de specie differentibus prae-
dicatur. Exempla, Seneibc'le et Rationale.

It has been already shewn, that the differcnce
joined with the qenes constitutesa species. If that
species be sebalem, (that is, such as is also a qenes
to some subordinate species,) the dfference which
constitutos it is denominated henric, and is predicated
of all the subordinate species; thus, the difference‚
occtpyihy space, is predicated of every thing concern-
ing which body is predicated; namely, of the two
species, animate and {aenimate body. But the deffer-

ence which constitutes a lowest speciosis calledepeci- ’

fic,· sor it applies only to theindividualscomprehended

under the species; thetis, it is predicated of things
differing numerically. Thus rational is predicated of
all the individuale to which the name of the species
man applies.
