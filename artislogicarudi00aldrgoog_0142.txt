· PROPOSITIONUM. 1⁶29

Particulor negative propositivus are not converti-
ble either simply or per accidens. For since the
subject is not distributed, the converse would require
the predicate to be undistrihuted: which is impos·
sible in negative propositivus.

3. The third species of convdrsion is called cou-
versiou oy vegetiori, or by contrapositiou. lt is
affected by transposiup the extremes, and combining
with each of them the porticulo infinitivus, uot: or
more simply, by corubiuiup thot negative particle virt
tlte uew subject aud changiup tlte esseutiol quality ο]
the original proposition. ,This methodis applicable
to universal affirmative and particular negative pro-
positione. The inference of the converse from the
primary proposition is perfect, and the conversion
reciprocal; since the two propositione are necessarily
true together, or false together.

l. For instance, the universal affirmative sen-
tence, All virtues ore habits, converted by negativa
or contraposition, becomes, All not-habits ore uot-
virtues, or more simply, No vot-laodite are virtues:
that is, as more familiarly expresscd, Nove but habits
ore virtues, or, Habita alone ore virtues, or, Whatever
unct a ltabit is uot a virtue. And this is implied in
the former; l'or if the quality or attribute denoted by
the term habits belongs to ull virtues, it must
follow that whatever does not possess that quality
cannot belong to the class of virtues. And vice
versd: if nothing which is destitute of a certain
quality belongs to a certain class, it follows that
every individnal of the class possessas the quality.
Therefore reciprocally, il it is known to be true, that
Whatever is unt o labit is not u virtue, it must be
inferred that, All virtues are habits.
