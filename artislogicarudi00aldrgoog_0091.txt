78 DE DEFINITIONE.

Hect is the wnsetion produced by caloric nn ani·v
mated bodies.

A Proposih'cn is a declaratory sentence.

Parallelepram‚ a plene rectilineal four-sided
figure, the opposite sides of which are parallel. ¹

A logical definitinn is most complete when it con-
siste cs the term signifying the proximate genus,
with that denoting the primary characteristic, or dit-
fcrence. But it may also be composed of e mere
distant genus with a succession ni differences or dis·
tinguishing epithets. This is often rendered neces·
sery by the porerty of lenguage, which does not
afford a name for every genus. Thus tha proxi-
mete genus of parallelcpram has nc appropriate
name. The class to which that genus is subordi-
nate is likewise nameless. lt is necessary therefore
to ge beck tc a still more abstract term, styure: to
which adifference or epithet is added, to constitute
the subordinate class or species, plane-fiynre. This
term is then employed as the name of a genus, and
is accordingly limited by another differem, recti-
lineal. The aggregate, rectilineal-plcnefiyure, is
further reduced tc asubordinate class hythe eddi-
ticn ciscur·sided. The whole compound word, four·
sided-rectilineal-planefipere, represents the proxi-
mnte genus cf parallelcpram, to which it only re-
mains to append the speeific difference, hacinp-its-
opposite-sides·parellel. Sometimes this methed is
resorted to ior scientific purposes. So men instead
of being deciared te he a rational animal, may be
logicelly defined, a beinq endewed with independent
existence, definite form, sclidssy, erynnizction, lise,
sensatien, end reason: the aggregate of all the ideas
except the last constituting thet which is denoted by
the term animal.
