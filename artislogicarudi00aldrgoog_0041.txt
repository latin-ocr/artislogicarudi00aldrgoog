Some words are equivocal to the eye alone, but not
to the ear, as, mora, (delum, mulberriess) mula,
(a jaw, missortunes.) Others to tho ear alone,
as, heir, air: hair, hore: seul, sole.

Proper Names uray be considered as partalring
in some measure of this equivocol quality. The
name Thomas, t'or instance, is applied to those who
are so called, not as to individuale of the same
class, or bearing any common character intended
by that name, but in a manner wholly arbitrary and
independent.

cation. From that signification, as a common
source, fiow a variety of particular applications;
whence they aresaid to be coequatty applied to many
things. For, of the aggregate of notioris represented
by the term iu its original use‚sometimesono portion
aud sometimes another is discarded, a few only of the
leading ideas being retained. Thus the words be-
come appropriated in a modilied and subordinate
sense to objects which bear uo moro than an ana-
logy or similarity to their original application. For
