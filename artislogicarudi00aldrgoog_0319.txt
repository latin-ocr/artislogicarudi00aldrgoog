806 FALLACIAE

word is employed throughont; and most frequently,
not in a manner which can strictly be called equivo-
cal, but only with a slight modification of meaning.
“lt would require,” says Burlre, ‘⁴ along disclosure
to point out the many fallacies which lurlr undar the
generality and equivocal nature of the terms Incede-
quate Repretcrttatt'ort.” Α similar observation may
be made concerning a great number of words in
Δ common use, as Lt'berty, Emancipott‘ou, Espediertcy,
Pleasrtre, Potriotism, Sacrament, Conuersion, Chris-
tian, &c Tha word Cburclt has often been made
an instrument of delusion, while in one part ol
the apparent argument it has baeu employed to

a definitior⁹ reason, repord: coegerim, as applied
to temporanee, pruolense, sourtd judpmeut: πίστις,
credente, confideres, fidelem, percussivo, proos:
algori, excellence, valor, moral virtue. The inac-
curacy may frequently be detected hy transferring
the passage into sonte other language, in which the
same analogias and associatione are not attached to
the same words. Thus the circumstances of Greece
were such as would naturally almost identify io the

· minds of the inhabitants the notions of state, and of

city: so that itis not snrprising to find, in the course
of the same argument, the word πόλις so employed,
that in one place the former ol those notions, and in
another place the latter, may be more prominent.

lt does not, however, follow, that every such
transition creates a fallacious argument. The
