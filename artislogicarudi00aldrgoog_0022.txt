error lies. One important purpose oi Logia is, by
analysiog the mental process, and by classifying the
various occasions oi error in the mode oi deducing
inferences, to aliord a facility in detecting fallacies.
It may be further observed, (although the observa·
tion does not immediately belong to this branch oi
the subjeet,) that ii the previous judgments on which
an argument depende, or either of them, be inac-
curate, while the reasoning process is carried on
correctly, the new judgmaot deduced iram them
will probably, but not necessarily, be erronaous. lt
from the principles, Singularity ought ty all means to

arcis is singularity, it is inferred that, To continue .

sober in a company os drunhards ought ty att means
to he cuoidedr the argumentative process is correct;
and the falsehood oi tha conclusion is to be attri-
bute} to the falsehood of the principle on which it ie
foun ed.

This is one of the most extensive means of the
propagation oi error; aod itis the more effectual,
because, in consequence oi the elliptical mode oi
argument usually adopted, the unsouud principle
does not meet tha eye or ear, but is only insinuated.
This is the cesa in the two following examplas, iu
which the false principle that any mensures, however
unlawfnl. may bc resorted to sor the purpose of
maintaininp reputation or auoidin9 unpleasant im-
putations, is implied though not expressed.

I must accept a challenye, or else I shall incur the

Reuenpe is usually esteemed a marh os a nobie
spirit, and is therefore to be indulged in order to main-
tcin our reputation.

Thus the Pherisees argued hom au erroneous

viour was not of God, because he kept not the sabbath
day according to their traditione.
