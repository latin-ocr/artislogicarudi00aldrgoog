DEMONSTRATION E. 191

by dead-neuter, these classes differ from each other.
The conclusion therefore is that tlte plant called

dead-nettle ir not the real actile.
sigeia, il the quality oi maleiny yood reseas the

hreawledye acquired is universally characteristic of
nne nten3 and if there are learned rnen who do not
possess the quality oi maltiny yoad use af their ac-
quired knowledycr then those learned nien destitute
ol that quality must be excluded from the whole
class ol the raiae. Hence the argument, All wisc
men make qood ase cf the knowledye they hane uc-

tante learned rnen are not wisc.

This principle can only prove disagreement ot'

aneyatioe premiss. The major premier must also
denote the entire comprehension or exclusinn oi the
quality adduced3 ibatis, it must be universal.

The principle ol the aurun arcuna is this: ‘⁴ If

“ predicated ol the same class, or portion of a class,
“ or individuah) it is thereby proved that they rnuy
‘⁸ agree with eech other. Or, if one is excluded
‘¹ from, and the other existe in, the same subject, it
“follows that they may differ from each other.’'
The former case proves the qualities in question to
be compaiibla with each other3 the latter proves
thern to be separante from each other. Hence the
conclusione founded on this axiam are necessarily
particular. And when the conclusion is negative,
the major premiss (and not the minor) must be
negative3 because the major term is denied oi a
portion of the minor term3 so that the minor pre-
mier must uniformly be affirmative.

ll, sor example, the two qualities, responsibih'iy

ject, man, (as expressed by the premises, Ali men
