DE DIVISIONE. 'tl

The difficulty of secaring a perfect division is
obviated when the subject admits oi the dichotomy,
or distribution constituted by the use ol trvo coa-
tradictory terms; that is, of a definite term with its
corresponding indefinite, as described on pagoib.
Thus, all matter is organizat or nnorgunized. Oi
such divisione several exemplos occur on pagos 59
and 60. Every correct twofold division implies this
contradiction. The division of history into sacred
aud profane is equivalent to sacred aad not-sacred.
The division oi literary compositioas into poetry and
prose, either signifies poetry and not-poetry, or else
lies open to an objection; since a question might
asise whether such works as Ossiau aad Telemachus
do not belong to both, or ιο an intermediate class.
Thus it is possible to conceive oi the lature discovery
of some warmblooded animali which shall be neither
vivebamus nor ossiparoasr neither mammiserons nor
penniferons, or eren uniting both these characters.
But according to the present state oi knowledge
aad the probable inserenoes of legitimare indumine,
those distinctions ere virtually the sameas mammi-
seroas and non-mammiseroas; vioiparoas end non·
uiuiparons.

The three rules above given are essential ιο ιΙιο
correctness of a division. But the propriety and
elegunce of the arrangement, as well as its adapta-
tion to the memory, will depond much on the follow·
ing edditional rules. All the members of a division
should contat of collaterat species: aad, All the'
denominatione os the several members should have
reference to tome common principle or leading idea.

The latter of these requisites is wanted in Cuvier's
arrangement of mammiseroas animale into tlre follow-
ing orders3 dimano, quadrantino, sarcophago, ro·
dentia, pachyderrnnta, ruminantia, ostentata, and
tetncea ln the elassificstiou oi Blumenbach‚ the
term cctncen does not coincide nith tha donomina-
