822 FALLAOIAE

This fallaoy is of frequent occurrence lt is
occasioned sometimes by ignorance; but more fre·
quently hy the desire to prop up a weak oause, or to
detract from the influenoe of its opponente.

Bishop Latimer complains of the use of this fallaoy
for the purpose of throwing discredit on the Reform·
arion. ‘⁶ lt is not, he says, we preaohers that
trouble England: but here now is an argument to
prove the matter against the' preachers. Here uros
preaoln'np against conetousness all the last year ia
Laut, ond the nent summer followed rebellion ,· there·
fore preaclrinp against conetensnees roas tlte oense of
tle rebellr'on. A goodly argumentl” He illustratas
this style ef argument by the answer of an old man
to the Commissioner appointed to discover the oause
of the accumulation of the Goodwin Saudo. ‘⁸ For·
south, Sir, 1 am au old man. Ι think that Tenterden
sleeple is tlte conse of tlte Goodwin Sands, For Ι am
an old man, sir, aud Ι may remember the building
of Teuterden steeple: and Ι may remember when
there was no steeple at all there: and before that
Tenterden steeple was in buildiug, there was no
manner of speaking of any flats or sends that stop·
ped the haren. And therefore Ι think that Teuterden
steeple is the cause of the deoay and destroying of
Sandwich haven.”

The Athenian orators continually employed thie
mode of fallacious argument, by insinuating against
each other the charge of bribery. To attribute
motivas is indeed afavourite practice of disputante
in all ages and countries. For example: “ lt is
evident that the opposition to this measure is vex·
atinus. lt is merely the effect of jealousy on the
part of Honourable Members who ure longing for
office, but feel it to be out of their grasp. lt is
impossible therefore to place any relianoe either on
their facts or their arguments.'’

The friends of Job nore misled by this fallecy,
