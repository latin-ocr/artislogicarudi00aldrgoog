Nowpdhe original premisse are (by hypothesis)
true; therefore the contradictory of either of them
is false: but tha new conclusion is the contradictory
of the original minor promise: therefore that new

Thereiore one oi those promises is false: this can·
not be the major premiss, (which is the same as the
original major, and has been granted to be true:)
therefore the minor premissa is false: therefore its
contradictory is true. But its contradictory is the
original conclusionz therefore the original conclusion
is true, and correctly inferred from the promises.
