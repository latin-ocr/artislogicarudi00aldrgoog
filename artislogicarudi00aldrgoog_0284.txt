Opiniou, or Belief, ir founded on Probability. That
is really probable which is veri simile ‚- that is, which
bears a greater resemblance to truth than its contra-
dictory does. That is apparently or relatively pro-
bable, in which there appears or is supposed to exist
a resemblance to truth. Actual or oly'ectiae proba-
bility exista in those things in which there is no
uniform or necessary censeor antecedent, but which
occur t, ixl ri xlta, having (to speak metaphori-
oally) a certain bias more or less strong to one of
two or more different results. Thus, if a die bar
on each face a different number, the throrring any
certain number in preference to another is neither
probable nor improbable, but indifferent. But if
it be marked on three sides with oue, on two
sides with troo, and on the remaining side with
tlrree, there is an actual probability that the trois·

will be least frequently, and the aee most frequently
thrown. On the other hand, the sanguine pur-
chaser of a lottery ticket bearing a favourite number
tliults there is a great probability of obtaining a
large prize; whereas the actual probability is ex·
actly the reverse. And if he has formerly obtained

a large prize by a ticket of the earne number, the
relative probability, that is, his fancy or imagination
as to the chance of the same result a second time,
may perhaps be increased in the sama ratio in which
its actual or absolute probability is diminished. .
There are an infinite number of degrees both in
real and in apparent probability. And a similar
variety exists in the strength of the opinion or belief
produced by them. Thelowest degree is suspicion,
