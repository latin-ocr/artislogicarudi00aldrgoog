DE DIVISIONE. 67

Logicel division may be thus distinguished frorn
physicel division. ln the lormer the divided-whole
may be universelly prediceted of each of the diuid-
iny memberss as alicime, oll cah, cll beecher, &c
are timber-trees: all nien, cll dmitos, ere animols.
But this cannot take place in the latter. Moreover,
physical division can be applied to individuale only 3
logical division only to classes.

To these two species of division may be added a
third, which may be called metaphysicel division.
lt consiste in an anelysis of the more simple ideas
which form the component parts of a complex idea.
This method is adopted, for example, when Mon is
contempleted, first in reference to those qualities

which he possesses in common with other enimals; ¹

end then, with reference to his distinguishing cha.
racteristics es man: the't is, in other words, the
idea of mon is divided into the two parts, animolity
and rationality. Thus repentonce has been divided

into convictione, contrition, confession, end forsokinp
os sin. This process mey be distinguished from
ioyicol division on the same principle as the physicol
division3 namely, the thing-divided cannot be pre-
dicated ol each pert separately. lt cannot be asserted

that all cortviction ol sin, all sorrow for sin, all con-
fession, or even allsorsohiny of sin is repentonce.

Logioel division is the converse of abstraction.
The tehles on peges 59, 60, and 61, illustrate both.
ll the terme are considered in the retrograde order,
from right to lelt, that is, from the lowest species to
the successive genera, they represent the process ol*
abstractim. lf read in the order in which they
stand, from lelt to right, they represent the opposite
process, namely division.

Animols rney be logicelly divided into rational
