ι 1³2 DE CONVERSIONE &c

Some men os great cbilitr'es are net agreeablc in
manners cr disposition:

Some persons who are not agrcecblc ic mannen cr
disposition cre men (gf great abilities.

This method ef conversion isos extensive use,
both for logical end rhetorical purposes. Itislo-
gically usesul‚ in the enalysis of arguments for the
purpose os reducing them to form; andin the de-
monstration os the correctness of syllogisms. Itis
rhetorically useful, because the negative cr contra·
positcry converse frequently conreys s sentiment
withmere perspicuity and emphasis than the pri·
mary form. Thus, All who deservo tlte fair cre
breve, is weak in comparison with its equivalent
sentence in the converted form, None but the breve
deserve tlte sair. This observation applies most
fully to the conversion os universal affirmative sen·

rences, as is obvious from several of the examples
above given.
