Itis thus, also, thet the utility of vaccinotioa has
been established. lt was not sufficient that a vast
mass of individual instances of successful vaccination
should be adduced; every search andi enquiry has .
been made to discover sailures. These hare been
accurately recorded, and diligently examined. Many
were found to be merely idle reports. Others proved
to be instances of real failure. The circumstances
attending these cases heve, ae far as was practicable‚
been scrutinized. The proportion of failures to the
successful cases has been ascertained to an astonish-
ing degree of precision; and the beneficia! effecte
of the practice hare by this process been far more
undeniably and satisfactorily established, than they
would have been by any vagus assertion of its uni·
versal and unerring efficacy.

The lawe or conclusione acquired by induction
are syllogistically applied to any new case in which
no opportunity of observation or experiment is
afforded. But such cases, es soon as observatius
or experiment can be applied to thern, reciprocally
become parts of the aggregate from which the con-
clusion is derived, and consequently are fresh con·
firmatione to the general law. Thus by a syllo-
gistic application of general principles, the laws
which regulate the motion of the planet Uranus
were ascertained before it had accomplished the
tenth part of its orbit from the place in which it
was discovered. When observation shall have
traced it till its return to that place, those laws will
no longer depend on the syllogistic inference3 but
will be established by induction, and will afford
additional* confirmation to the already-discovered
laws of the motione of the heavenly bodies in ge·
neral. Each successive observation of astronomers

constitutas a part of the inductive process; as does
also the fact that Flamsteed, Meyer, and Le
Mennier have pointed out setar, which are now not
discoverable, iu the very places where, according to
