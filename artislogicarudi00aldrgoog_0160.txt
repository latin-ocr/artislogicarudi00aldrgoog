Therescrc humility couuot he too deorly purchased.
For the major term is, o good which cannot he too
decrly purchased: and the minor termis, humility:
but instead of a single middle term, one of these
extremes is compaied with, true urisdom,· and the
other withmere quality which accompouies true
uisdoru ; which are distinet terme.

This rule is obviously violated when an argn-
ment contains an equivocal word employed in dif-
ferant significatione. But it also extends to every -
occasion in which, through the imperiection ol'
languags, the same word is applied in sensas which,
although analogous to esch other, are not precisely
the sume. lt is impossible, indeed, to avoid giving
to almost every word which is employed, various
shedos and modificatione of signification, so that
they shall denote sometimes a greater aod some·
times a smaller number oi simple notione. li
however we allow that variety in the use oi the
same word in the course of the same argument,
we are guilty ol fallacious reasoning. When, for
instance, it is affirmed that, Thct which is preater
theusuith aud hope is the highest Christian procer
and thet, Chority (love) is preater thau scith aud
hope ,- and from these principles it is inserted that

perlectly correct if the terme ete applied throughout
in the seme meaning. But there is danger ol its
being perverted by some, who will acquiesce in the
truth oi the premiss in the purast sense of the word
expedieucys but will practicelly apply the con·
clusion in tbe corrupt sense ol the word, namcly,

as signifying that which, whether right or uroug,
