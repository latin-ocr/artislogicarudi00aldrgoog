ente, which is termed the matter ol the proposition;

and ‘which must be either necessary, impossible, or
eontinpent.

1. When the predicate denotes a quality nenes-
snrily attached to tho subject, the proposition is in
signification universal, and wants only the si9n to

render it formally so. Of this nature are the lol-
lowing: „
Humnn plans, however well laid, are linhle to
disappointment ; that is, All human plens.

Erayyerated commendatione defeat their oron pnr-
pose hyexoitinp suspicions that is, All eraqyeratecl
commendatiores.

2. If the predicate denote a quality wholly incom-
patible with the subject, and the extremes thus
essentially differ, in this case also the proposition
will be equivalent to nn universal: thus,

The most prudent os human plens are not suffi-
cient to ensure success ; that is, No human plens,
even the most prudent, ore sufficient, &o

Old soldiers do not uillinyly uenture beyond the

ἵνρε os enprrinnon, that is, No old soldiers venture,
c.

Brutos neither eal nor drinh more than nature re-
quires ,· thetis, No hrntes, &o

3. But if the proposition, whether affirmative or
negative, he suoh thet tho predicate may be asserted
ol some things eomprehended in the subject, and
denied of others; that is, is its extremes only oeci-
dentally ugree or differ3 it isin sense n particular
proposition. Thus,

Victories have been painel under every eircum-
stante ofdisodoontn9e; thet is, Some victorine.

While brutes neither ent nor drinh more than
nature requires, rnen depende themselves by encess
even below the level of the broten that ir, Some
rnen depende themselves.
