CONDITIONALIBUS· 253

conditional proposition, it is further evident, that,
supposiny the condition to be true, the essertion will
then be necessarily true. lt therefore it is ascer-
tained that the assertion is not true, it must follow
that the condition is not true. This principle gives
occasion to the second rule: Ι] the consequentis
denica, the antecedent is also to he denteri. The
syllogism formed on this principle ie said to be of
the destructive form. Thus,

If words were not amhiynous, they would never
have been the occasion of useless controversy: But
they have repeatedly been the occasion of useless
controversy: Therefere they are arnhiyuous.

If each man ouyht to have more wives than one,
more than one would have heen yiven to Adam: But
not more than one was picen to Adam: Theresore
each man ouyht not to have more than one.

If they had been of us, they would have continued
utith us: hut they went ont, that they might be made
manifest that they were not att os ns: (l John ii. 19.)
that is, destructively; dut they did not continue with
ns,· therefore they were not osus.

If the inheritunce be of the law it is no more os
promise ‚· hut it was yiven to Abraham hy promise ;
therefore it is net os the law. (Gal. iii. 18.)

3. The assertiones the consequent, er the denial
oi the antecedent, cannot authorize any conclusion.
For the conditional proposition affirms only that the
yiven antecedent must be attended by the yiven con·
sequent. But it does not denote any limitation to
the consequent. For although that consequent moy
accompaay the yiven antecedent, yet it is not ex-
clusirely confined to it; but may also follow from
some other antecedent. For instance:
