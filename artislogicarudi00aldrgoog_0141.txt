ldthese’ and similar sentences mthe subject and the
predicate are co· extensive, and therefore reciprocal.
Thus also ii rt is true that Cicero was the discoverer
of Cataline's conspiracy, it is equally true that the
discoverer of Cataline’s conspiracy wne Cicero.

Bur when this is not the case, an universal affirm-
ative proposition cannot be simply connected: as,

Adnirrtng that the mecting nus nn illegnl suerting,

il does not necessarily result that it mus o ήοιοιιι one,-
sor although a ιιόιοιιι meeting ir therefore nn illegnl
one ‚yetit is not thence to he inferred, os α muller os
course, thot yfilkgal, it must he riotonr.

Aliud eatjur civile, clindjns gentiam. Quod ciuile,
non idern continuo gentium qnod nalem gentiunt, ideni

civile esre dehet.

The inserence ιιι the caseos occidental conversion
is not so complete ns in simple conversion3 lor the
accidental converse does not necessarily retain the
accidental quality ol the leading proposition, when
the latter' rs salse. lt a proposition be true, its con-
verse, whether simple or accidental‚ must he truer'
hut on the contrary, ii a proposition besche, although
its simple converse must he false, yet its accidental
converse may he either true or false: ιο that the
conversios cannot he reciprocal. For conversion per
occidens depends on the lews ol subaltern opposition;
in which the particular does not necessarily retain
the accidental quality oi the universal, except when
that universal is true.

Hence ir cannot he inserted lrorn the salsehood oi
the propositione, No Hottentots possess reason, All
who ore promotiny the qood os their follow creaturos
ore weolthy men, that the accidental converse oi
each is ials03 namely, Some who possess reason ore
not Hottenlolsr Some weolthy rnen are promotinq
the qood of their follow creatures: these propositicns
being in laet true.
