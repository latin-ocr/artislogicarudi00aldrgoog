120 DE PROPOSITIONUM

Thus it is equally true that Some planete are at-
tended reith satellites, aud that Some planete are not
attended with satellites. But ii itis asserted, iu
necessary matter, that Some diamonds consist <escon
densed carbonc (which may be affirmed ol all dia·
monde ;) or, in impossible matter, that Some pbiloso-
phers are not free from error, (which is likewise
predicable of all 3) these propositione ere true, but
their respective subcontraries are falsu namely,
Some diamonds do not conset of mutnet carlom
Smne philosophos cre free from error.

t. Subcltern oppositiore takes place between any
'two propositione which differ iu quantity only; as,
All human lares are imperfect ,· Some human heros arc χ
imperfect. No men have en affectionate disposition ‚·
Some men lave not on effectionem disposition.

Suboltern propositione may be botlt trun or both
salse,- or the universal may be false, and the parti·
cular true. The universal proposition is called sub-
alternans,· the particular, subalterncte. The relation
between them is scarcely to he called oppositione iu
the common acceptatiou of the word, though it comes
within the range of the delinition which has here
been given of that term.

ll an universal propositionis true, the particular
which is comprehended under it is also true. For
the universal includes the particular. ll att men
are martel, it follows thet any some men, that ie,
any particular class or number of men, are mortal.
To deny therefore that some men are mortni, would
be to essert the former proposition to be at the same
time true and not true.

lf the particular is false, the universal which
comprehende it must be false likewise. lf it is salse
that some planete cre motionlesa it must continue
false when involved iu the universal, att planete ore
metientess. Consequently, that universal must be
also false.
