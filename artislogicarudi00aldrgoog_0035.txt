22 DE NOMlNlS

spirit ln perfectiore, is also a categcrenu and the less
complex termo which form a part ol it are, when
tehen in connexion, reduced tc the rank of syn-
categcrerns.

The third class of raised worda comprehends all
grammatical verbs, except the substantive verb in
the indicative mode and present tense, which simply
denotas unqualified existence, divested of all notion
of time or mode. Thus Ι stand, logically resolved,
denotesI am standing ; and, by the completiones
the predicate, I nm n person standing.

Nomen Lageam, est Terminus simplex sine ,
tempore significativus. Nam ex antedictis,
Terminus simplem idem valet atque vox arti-
culata et recta, et ex instituto significans; si-
quidem exclusae sunt voces inarticulatae, quasque
natura sponte suggerit3 voces autem obliquae

sunt Syncategoremata.

Logicnl Nonne ere equivalent to Simple Terms, or
Categnrems. They are signiJioatioe: in oppositicn to
adverbs, prepositicns, conjunctions, &a which have
nc actual signification, bnt either merely unite into
one sentence the words with which they are connected,
or qualily them, or denote certain relations which
subsist between them. They dc not express time.-
and thus are distinguished from verbs,which, by the
changes of terminatione or by the help of auxiliarios,
denote time past, present, and future.

The definition of a Loyicnl Nona given· in the
text is not accurate. lt appears to imply that the
Nona is a kind of simple term, distinguished from
other kinds of simple terms hy the adjoined qna-
lities, sipuificant, and inexpressinc nJ' time. er'eteas
in lact these qualitics are casentini to a simple term5
