invention. lt begins with those things which are
most known. lt first ascertains their respective pro·
perties and relations, and then, either actually or
mentally‚ separatas, arranges, and classifies them;
comparing or contrasting thern with each other and
with those of other objects; and tracing back con·
sequents to their antecedents and effecta to their
causes. lt thus proceeds by a path opposite to the
course of nature, until it arrives (in reference to
objects of sense) at simple or undccompoundable
substances; or (in reference to subjecta of meta·
physical apprehension) at the most abstract ideas;
or (in reference to matters of science in general)
at universal principles or laws.

This is in fact the process already described under
the name of induction. (p. ssa-237.) Thus it is
observed that heot existe in the rays of the sna, in'
culinory and subterraneam fire, in solida or liquida
exposed to the influence of fire, in animal dodica,
dre. By repeated examinations and comparisons,
the accidente of beat„ (which are discovered by their
existence in some things which contain that quality
and their absence from others, and by the compara-
tive degrees of beat in different substances,) are
separated from those things which, being discovered
to be uniformly present with it, are supposed to be
essential to it. Hence is ultimately derived the
definition oi beot. The definition is necessarily the
last step, since it expresses the natura os the thing,
the discovery of which was the object of the ana·
lysis; or at least, the nearest approximatione to
that nature, which the state of the science or the
limited powers of man can attain.
