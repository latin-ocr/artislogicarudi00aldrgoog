PROPOSITIONUM SPEOIES. 10³

’Epirum αἱ πὸσιι irroret.

’Υμιῒς ei veiente οὐκ inerit nigrat.

Thone forms also oi particular propositione which
haee a specific limitation, (es, many, not many, sero,
almost att, διε.) have practically the character of
singalart: as, Most nationt are too easily eecited to
war: thetis, Tite majority ostentione.

4. indefinite Propotitions, having ior their
subJect a common term without any sign either of
universality or oi limitation, are ambiguous as to
their extent. They convey no intimation whether
the subject denotas att or a port only oi the indivi-
dual things to which the word is applicabis ε as,

Antan imprecer more ty reading the story of a
perron eminent sor prudente and cirtae, titan by tte,
fineet rnlee qi morolity.

Tragical representatione eff human noe make a

Tite productione of a green genius, nith marry
laptee and inadvertenciee, are infinitety preferable to

thehnppre eruet and correct rnorks of on inferior

Errare are marles ofinfirrnity.

Errare creep into tlte rnort prudent undutaiingr.

Such propositione are ambiguous, auditis the
office oi common sense, guided by an acquaintance
with the branch of science to which the proposition
relatos, or the connexion in which it occurs, to de·
cide upon the extent in which the subject is to be
taken. One oi the queiitics, t'or instance, which is
above predicated oi errore, namely, that they are
marks nfirrfirrnity, belongs to the subject uniuer-
taily5 ior att errore are such. The other predicate,
however, creep in to the most prudent unmaiinys,
can only he said oi tone erroro. This ie therefore a
particular proposition, the former is universal.
