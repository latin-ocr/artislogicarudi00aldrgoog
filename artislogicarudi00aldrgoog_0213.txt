2⁰⁰ DE REDUOTIONIS

Agein, let the following syllogism in Bokcrdo‚
that io, Dolecmos, be given to be reduced.

Some oete cs injurtice ure not coynizable hy human
lcum

All octe eff injustice are rocicl evils,-

Theresore some socicl evils are not coyuizable by
human lawr.

By converting the major premiss by contraposition‚
end transposiug the promises, c syllogism is formed
in Dorii; thus,

All acts os injustice ure sociul evils ,·

Some practices not coynizcble by human luws ure
acts os injustior.

From which premises flows the conclusion,

Therefore rome practices not copnizable oy human
lawr are social evils.

The conclusion from the original promises is the
simple converse oi this new conclusion, end conse-
quently inferible from it.

The latter process may be more simply described
thus. By combining the negative with the major
extreme the syllogism is reduced to Discmis, and
the reduction to the first figure moy he performed

according to the directions given for thet mode.

The mode Camestres may also be convenieutly
reduced by the nepulive conversion of its mry'or
premiss: the minor premiss becoming affirmative by
the combinationes the particle with the predicate.
For example,

Whalever is unchucpecble is free from imper-
fection:

No human institutione arefree from imperfectiori:

No human institutione are unchanyeuble.

Which by contrapository reduction will stand thus:

Whutever is not free from imperfectiori is nol
unchanyeable;
¹ Humcn institutione ure not free from imperfectiori:

Human institutione ore not uochouqecble.
