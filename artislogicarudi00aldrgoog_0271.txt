2⁵8 DE SYLLOGISMIS.

their subjects, wcrcld be a stote iu which the swoy ry*
ruch monarche would uot be objectiouoble:

The state iu which all meu should be what they
ought to be would be a stole iu which absolute mo-
uorchs would have up other object iu view thou the

welfare of their subjecte:

Therefore thet stote iu which vll meu should be

A conditional syllogism is innormat, unless its
terms may be strictly reduced to three. For in·
stance; If Livy is a faithful aud judiciove historiar,
we may rely ou the facts which he relates ,- but he is
a faithful aud judicious historiam (for so he was

others are contradicted by 'credible historicust)
therefore he was uot a foithfiil aud judiciove his·
teriou. Thet is, No writer whose narratives ore uot
