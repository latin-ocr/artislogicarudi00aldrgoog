Quaestionis duo sunt extrema, Subjectum et
Praedicatum3 quorum de Convenientih vel Dis·
sidio inquiritur, ope termini alicujus tertii;
idque propter Canoues sequentes, in quibusvis
1 omnis syllogistica fundatur.

lt hae been observcd (page 5.) that the terms
npreement a'nd diccprecrrent arsfipuratively applied
ro the termaoi a proposition. Ape-emeat duee uct
denote that the terma are absolutely equivalent tc
each other. It simply means that the predicate
(metaphysically speaking) describes a quality which
is attached to the subject; as, (ιἰοιι is preca, denotas
that the attribute oi precanter belongs ιο praec: or,
(ιο describe the same thing logicaliy,) that the pre·
dicate' rs a class or genus, which comprehende the
subject aa the whole or a subordinate portion of
itself; aa, Grcce' ιι preest. aeserta that the genus
preca thinpe contains undet rt the species prete.

Terms are therefore said to apree with each uther,
when cua of tham can ba affirmatively pradicated ci
the other: they disagree, when the nnc cannot be
predicated of the other. In estimating the agree-
ment οι disagreament, each term must bs taken in
conjunction with its appropriate sign,· that is, in
reference ιο its actual extent in tha proposition.
