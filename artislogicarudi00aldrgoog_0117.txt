Α 104 PROPOSI'l'lONUM SPECIES.

Indefinite propositivus may be distinguished from
, singular propositione by the following characteristic.
Every indefinite proposition will admit of some sign,
either universal or particular: but a singular propo-
sition will not receive either. The following are
therefore not indefinite but singular:

Tite English cre tlte sovereipms os tlte ocean.

Tm heaveoly bodies form one harmonious system.
lt cannot be correctly said, Every Englishmon is, or
Some Enplislvmem ore the sovereipns os the eccam
Eooh of tlte heuvenly bodies, or Some heuvemly bodies
form one system. The subjecte ere collective, aud
therefore denote individuo! things or notione.

Although abstrect subjecte constitute singular
propositione, as hasbeen already stated, yet they
may sometimes be considered as implying a distri-
bution, aud in this case the propositione in which
they occur will be indefinite. Thus, in the sen·
tence‚ Pride was not modefor mun, the subject may
he taken distributively for each kind or consotios of
pride ς Νο pride (that is, uo species. or noseeliop ⁰f
pride) was modesor mon. Sometimes e particle oc-
curs iu the course of a proposition, which fixes the
extent of the subject3 thus the sentence, Emulotion
llos sometimes a good, oud sometimes n bod, tendentis,
may be inaccuretely used to signify, Some kinds os
emulatione are of good temdemcy‚· ond some kinds of
obad tendency.

The combinatiou of the universal sign with the
negative particle rendere a proposition indefinite,·or
ambiguous as to its extent; since thet form is em·
ployed sometimes iu au universal, and sometimes in
aportict'tlor sense. ln the following sentences it

denote: universality:

Non omnio possumus omnes.
Πὸς γὰρ virig trevir dtdpvvpius civi m utrm
ott’ i'gkvt ihesu. (leteoyn. Prope. 173.)
