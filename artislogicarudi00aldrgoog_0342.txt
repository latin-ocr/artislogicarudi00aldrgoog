apetitio principii, and unsvers. ⁸¹ Whether Hebe u
sinuetur no 1 know not, dre? But further cousi·
deration convinces him that the premiss was abso·
lutcly lalae3 and he boldly plessis, “ We know that
God heareth not sinners . . . ll thiemari were notos
God, he could do nothing.''

ln common langnage‚ the use of a premiss arow-
edly false, or the recurrence to one which has been
previously disproved‚ is called by the neme ol petitio
principii. See, ior instance, Chillingworth's ‘⁸ Reli·
gion οἱ ProtestantS‚'' chap. r. ᾖ. 25.

2. The second class ol fallacies under this head
consiste of those in which the promise assumed is
identical with the conclusion. The premiss isin
this case necessarily unproved aud doubtful, because
it is the very question for which prool is required.
And the argument is worthless‚ because no proposi-
tion can prove itself. This brauch of the petitio
principii is most correctly termed Beppinp tlte petes·
tion. Ol this kind are the following exemplos:

was a time when ite existence cornmeeced.

consiste in the pretended argument, uo oue cun de

in other words. The other consists in the surrep-
titious introduction oi the word equitoble in the
description ol tho subject, which anticipates the
very point which ought to be proved.
