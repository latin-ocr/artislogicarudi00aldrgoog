D10T10N IS. 307

verieties of meaning in which a word is employed
may be related to each other es a part to a whole;
and thus the meaning in one place may be compre·
hended in the more extensive application in which it
is used in tbe other plaoe; iu the same manner as a
limited or particular term, is comprehended in the
same term when distributed. Thus an inference
concerning πόλις, as denuting a city, or as meaning
a commowweoltlr, may sometimes be legitimately
drawn t'rom a premise in which thet word was em.
ployed in the entire complex signification which it
represented to an Athenian mind, namely, a city·
stote: or a stote consisting cf o city mittite de·
pendencics. The word ψυχὴ in like manner conveys
the complex sense of life and soul: end Plato has
sometimes, without violeting the soundness of his
argument, glided from one ol those applicatione to
the other. Ol a similar transition an instance oc·
curs in the lenguage of our blessed Lord in St. Mark
viii. ³5-37. lf the word brettias in the ninth chapter ·
uf the Epistle to the Hebrews is rightly understood
to signify a will or testament, the transition may be
accouuted t'or in the same mannen this being a
specific sense comprehended in the general notion ol
engagement. But it is probably more correct to
understand this word, whererer it occurs in the New
Testament, us uniformly denoting cooenont.

n. Fallacia Acoewtue seu Prosodt‘ae potius,
quando pro eodem sumuntur quae vel Limne,
wel Spiritu, vel Tempore, vel Accentu sunt di-
versa: ut, Est ceruus, Ergo est cemus,- Est ura,
Ergo est horo. Est malum (en epple), Ergo
mulum (an evil). Venatur lepores, Ergo et

lepdres: quibus qui falli potest, debet.
