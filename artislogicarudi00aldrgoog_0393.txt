Whereas you say that you have demonstrated
against us, thar Protestants divided themselves κ
from the external communion of the visihle Church;
we answer, This is not the qnod erat demonstrandum.

’ The point you professed to nr‘ v e was not that we
divided ourselves from the a..rual communion os
your Choreb, hut that we urvided ourselves from
the Churoh, and made ourselves outlaws from it: a
proposition which your argument does not' reach.

The reproach of aenrelers, [namely, as applied to
those who called themselves free-thinkers‚] he
[Collins, the author of a Diroonrre on Fre-think· y
ing‚] confutes with ease, by a sels-evident propo· ’
sition: “For men that use their understandings
must have more sense than they that use them not.”
Very compendious, truly! But out of too much pre· i
cipitution he leaves his syllogism in the luroh. He
forgets to prore that every man that uses tis under.
standing is (in the meaning of his book) a free·
thinlrer. Without this, that same “renectere” will
still stick close upon him 3 and the closer for this
’ very syllogism. lt is mere ohieanery in the word.

A free-thiulfo, iu this soff-evident proposition, is
any mon thal uses his urrderrtanding, [as Collina herl
previously defined it,] that ia, that thinlra at all: a
very comprehensive delinition. And yet presently >
in the next paragraph, asree-tlrinlrer is but one ot a
thousand ; oue that depurtsfrom the sentimenta of the
lterd ofmunlrind ; thetis, (for he could scarce have
told it us in a plainer description.) a mere utheish
or at least no Christian. Are not these two accept·
atione of the same word wonderfully consistent?
