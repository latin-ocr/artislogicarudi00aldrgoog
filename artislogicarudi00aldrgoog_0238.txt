and in the direction of conduct in common life. A
natural enqniry therefore suggests itself: whence
ars those principles derived? Many of them rnay
indeed be syllogistically traced back to principles
more genereth and these again to others of e still
more general nature. But sooner or later the mind
is checked in this career. lt arrives at principles
in which indeed it cannot but acquiesce; but the
truth of which it cannot syllogistically demonstrate.

Of these principles, some rest solely on testimony
or authority. The majority of mankind, for in-
stance, implicitly receive their religious aud philo-
sophical tenets from their immediate ancestors, as
these also did from theim, and thus sometimes
truth‚ but more frequently error, is perpetuated. So
also a student may suppose himself to be following
the dictatos of his own mind, while he is really
influenced by esteem for the judgment of the author
whom he studies, or of the instructor to whose
guidance he intrusts himself. But the only general
principles which ought to rest on externel testimony,
are those of religione doctrine and obligatior, which
depend cn the immediate authority of Him who
cannot deceive or be deceived. Human testimony,
strictly speaking, is to be received only in relation
to facts: not for the establishment of general prin-
ci les.

pThe principles acquired by human powers have
been, by many, considered as twofold. Some have
been supposed to be intuitivas and these are com·
rnonly called ociosus: their extreme universality
