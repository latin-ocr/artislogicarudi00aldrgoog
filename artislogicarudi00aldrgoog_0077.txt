64 DE SPECIEBUS

homini eoae bipedem: 2, Quod omni, ct soli; ut

homini risibililue3 cujusmodi est quartum Prae-
dicabile.

Property, in the strictly logical sense in which it
' is employed as the name of the fourth class of pre·
dicables, denotas a quality attached to every indi*
ridual comprehended in the Genus or Species to
«which itis attributed, and not to any other objecta.
Itis therefore an universal aad an exclusive cha-
racteristic os the class.

But the word is also popularly used to denote any
quality found in every individual of a class, although
not exclusively confined to that class. Thus, mol-
leebilr'ty, fusibility, pellowness, welphi, velue, are
said to be properties of Gold: power os locomotion,
capabiliiy of feelinp pleasurc or pain, are raguely ’
called properties of Man.

Sometimes also the term Propertp is applied to
qualities exclusivaly but not universally belonging
to a class, (soli, sednon omni). In this sense,
philosophy, literature, virtue, prudente, hope of
future existence, are popularly but inaccurately
called properties of Man.

Accidens, curn essentiae junctum sit contiu-
genter, adesse igitur vel abesse potest, selvo
interim essentia Speciei3 Indiuiduo tamen ali·
quando tam tenaciter inhaeret, ut divelli atque
separari nequit; ut Menlnennrn esse, a Virgilio.
Quare vocatur Inseperubile. Quod autem ab
Indiuiduo separari potest, ut albedo, e pariete,
dicitur Seporohile. ⁵
