quarum signa sive voces dirigit3 eatenus enim

’ l. The operatione oi the mind as carried on in the
process ol reasoaing are so closely connected with the
use ol the words expressing thoes operatione, that it is
scarcely possible to separate them. Until the ex·
periment hasbeen made by close observation of the
actings of our own mind, it is difficolt to believe how
much the thoughts are under the influence ol the
lauguage: how dependent the mester is on the
serrant. Hence aa examination into tha nature
and use of words assiste greatly in correctiug the
errore to which the mental operatione are subject:
and Logia, while apparently conlining its attention
to the former, is actually the instrument of rectifying
and improving the latter.

Ι9. Logia may therefore be defined, The Serenae
ulrich lesches to reason bymem ⁰f tlte right ure os
words, or, The Art os reasoning by means of tlte
cor-recl use of words. lt is sometimes defined, The
Art of reasoning. Others hare defined it, An inarm-
mental ort directt’ng tlre mind in tlre acquisitiva ond
conmunicatiou of knowledge. These two delinitione
comprehend under the term logie the whole system
oi inductise as well as deductiva or syllogistic reason-
ing: whereas the definition in the text confines the
term to the syllogistic branch of reasouiug. And this
is more consistent with the origin ol the word logio,
as well as with the special object of this treatise.

3. Legio is both an art and arciense. As it isa
system of principles and rules discovered by observa-
tion and study, and laid down for the direction ol
others, it is arciense. As its use consiste io the
practical application of those principles and rules,
