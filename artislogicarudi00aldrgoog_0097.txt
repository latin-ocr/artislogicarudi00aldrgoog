ut DE DEFINI'I'IONE.

son’s definition of net-morl; namely, Any thing rc·
thaleted or decuerated with interdices between the
points ⁰f intersection.

On tlre contrary, the name ol a species, (being
necessarily the representative of a more complex
notion than that oi the genus to which it belongs,)
is incompotem to form a part oi the definition oi the
genus. An enumeration of the species would forma
correct definition as to extent, but would violate this
rule of perspicuity. Thus it would be illogical to
deflua Vegetoblet: aelate comprehending trees, chotha,

aad herde.
Collateral species oi the same genus (as bird,

benet, fich, dec.) aud correlative words (as right,
lest; fruit, fruit-trec,⁸ definitum, desinitio), are in
their own nature equally kuown; and therefore can-
not be correctly employed to explain each other.
Hence the following are inaccurate:

Apple; the fruit oi the appla-trae. Ι

The right lrnnd; not the lest.

Definitio· Oratio explicativa deliniti.

Necnortr any thing reticulated.

Judgment ; that which is expressed by the com-
bination of words into a sentence.

Triangle; afigure which has any oi its exterior

„ angles equal to its two interior aud opposite angles.

Restat, an animal distinguished from birds, insects‚
fishes, and men.

Words expressive of ideas purely simple cannot
bo properly defined. Hence the defiuitione oi the
operatione of the mind are less clear, or at the best
not more clear, than the operatione themselves:
they in iact do little more than substitute one de-
nomination for another.

In many other cases also the great difficulty of
framing a correct definition rendere a violation of
this rule almost unavoida‘ble. lu nominal defiuitione,
especially, a great degree oi latitudo may be allowed:
and itis osten sufficient if words relatively better
