tensive in their application as they appear to be; a
more limited subject being implisd in the context: as,

sary sor tle approooloing aetion had been prepared.

·Ῥι·οροείιίοηε universal inform have osten only a
fiyurative universality‚ as denoting that which may
bo said to bo (in the colloquial, not in tho logical
use of the word) yenerally true: as, ·

f An absolute universality may bo put to the test by
‘she denia} of the opposite; or by tho enumeration
olparts: ao,

the opposito is denied; There is noue riylteous: ond
she parts are enumerated3 All leus, ond ull Geu-
