246 DE CONCLUS. RETICEN DA.

For example; Lot the question be put by a sup-
posed enquirer ς Is it aot mroap to how down before
imapes? To which the instructor enswers thus: If
it is aot lowfal for Catholics to bow down in their
chapels, how soraee lt to be lawfal for Protestamts to
bow down themselves when they enter their charches?
Apaa'n, why do the Protectoats let boppars bow down
at their doorsfor a morsel of broad, their little chil-
drea bow down for their parents’ blessiap, the poor
bow down before the rich? And all the Profestoats
bow deson before the Lord's eapper; aad even to an
empty ehair when it is set for the kiap's throne ia the
parliamemt house. The argument is apparently an
arpamentam ad homiaem thus; Aap practice
maintained by oar opponente may be assumed to be
free from oh'eetion ,· bat bowinpe's a practice maia-
taiaed by oar opponente3 (ae proved by an inductiom
of particular instantes ,·) therefore bowimp moy be
assumed to be free from abjectiore. But this is not
the conclusion required: the question does not refer
to the objectionobleness of bowinp absolutely; but to
thet of bows'ap before imapes

It is therefore important that every hearer or
render should frequently recnl to his mind the recl
question under discussion, and examine whether

the arguments adduced apply to it, or to some other
proposition which bears a resemblance tuit.

A few exemplos (correct ond incorreet) of all
these modes of reasoning will he found at the close
of the Appendix‚ in the second series of “ Promis-
“ cuous Syllogisms.”
