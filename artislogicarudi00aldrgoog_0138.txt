PROPOSITIONUM. 125

either both distributed, asin 133 or neither distri·
based, as iu I. For iu these cases the mere trans-
position ol' the extremes, without any alteration oi
the sign, does not derange the quantity of the pro·
position. And ior this reason, its accidental quality
(its truth or salsehood) continues the same: that is,
ii any proposition is true, its simple-converse must

be also true: ii false, its simple-converse must be
salse. So that, although simple conversiou does
not partake of the nature of an argument, yet bs-
cause it educes a proposition which is necessarily
involved in the original sentence, it authorizes the
inference of the oue from the other. And thIs inier-
ence is reciproeal: ior ii either oi the two propo·
sitiens be laid down, the other may be inserted
fremit.

Since, therefore, the universal negative proposi-
tion, No ruminatiny animale ore carnivorovs, is
true, it is also true that, No carnivorovs crimnis are
ruminatirty animale. For, both extremes being dis-
tributed, the sentence, No rnmr'rrotiny animale are
carnivorum, declares that every carnivorum anmi
differs from every ruminatiny animal. Thereiore
reciprocally‚ every ruminatirry animal differe from
every carnivorovs ammai: that is, No carnivorons
animal is o rurnirtatirry arimal; or as it may be
more concisely expressed, No carnivorovs animale
ruminate.

On the same principle, since it is salse that No
kiter are birds of prey, it is salse that every kile
differs from every bird of prey. lt is therefore false
that every bird of prey differs from every ktre ; that
is, that rto birds osprey are laites·

The following are instances ol the conversion oi
true universal negative propositione:

No true philosophare omit the euforcemerrt os moral
mihine rrio omit the erfirrcemertt of moral duty are

true philosophare. Η
