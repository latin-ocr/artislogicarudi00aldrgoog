DE DILEMMATE 263

2. The marnarolo of a dilemmods, that euch
alternative must exootly opply. The following io
therefore inaccurate. If you study metaphysiossyou
motet either follow implicitly tho sentiments os some
writer on the mbjeot5 und theu you merely tole
thirsus upon trust: or else you must truce tho work·
inus of your own utimr ond then you will involve
yourseff iu inentriouble confusion. The second al-
ternative does not strike home, or compel assent.
A man may truce for himself tlte workinys of his

susten.

uir δημηγορεῖν· hir μὲν mig roi iham λέγω, ol tol με φιλέ-
mess· iris li roi litu, oi liofgunt.

The nature ol these rules proves that it requires
a considerable degree ol ingenuity to frame a di-
lemma which shall be altogether uuexeeptionable.

The following are instanoes of the Dilemmo.

Si uronis sit dolor, breuis erin si loayus, leuis ,¹
eryosortiterfsrendus. (Epicurean argument in cic.
Ft'tr. i. 12. end ii. 7.) That is, If any pain is
intoleroble or ulfowssff impatientes, it must oe either ,
seuere poia or protracted paim tut seuere pain
does aot authorize enpatmnoer (sor it is hut
manumet) nor does protracted puin authorize impu·
tiencet (fur protructed puin is not violent, but
sliqhu) therefore uo puin authorizes impurienee ,-
stat is, ull poia should be borno with fortitude.
