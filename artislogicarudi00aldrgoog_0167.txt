Quare Medium in praemissis semel ad mini-
mum distribui debet3 sufficit tamen, si vel
semel distribuatur. “ Nam l. ad probandum A
est C, conveniat C alicui B, et A omni; Ergo
ddem alicui B: Ergo affertur unum aliquod
idemque tertium &o 2. ad probandum A non χ
est C, conveniat C alicui B, et A differat omiti· ἵ

Ergo adem alicui B: Ergo affertur &o

The middle term will be free from ambignity if it ;
is orme distributed. lt is therefore indifferent to the ἶ
correctness of the argument whether it is distributod r
only once, or in both the promises. For isone oi the
extremes agrees with some port os limodiam, and
the other extreme agrees with every tliaq whiohis
signified by the medium: this extreme must also ἦ
agree with the same part oi the medium with which r
the former agrees: because the pert is included iu l
the whole. ,
Agein, if one extreme agrees with some part of ’
the things denoted by the middle term3 and the r
other extreme wholly differs from the middle term ,
· taken in its otmost extent ; then this extreme must ι
also differ from the part oi the middle term with
which the former extreme agrees. So thatin eecli l
ease, the medium is virtually the same in both the
premises.
